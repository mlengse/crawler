## [About Copilot code review](#about-copilot-code-review)

GitHub Copilot can review your code and provide feedback. Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code supports two types of review:

*   **Review selection:** Highlight code and ask for an initial review
*   **Review changes:** Request a deeper review of all your changes

The current functionality and availability of the two types of review is summarized in the following table:

### [Code review monthly quota](#code-review-monthly-quota)

The **review changes** type of Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota.

When you assign Copilot as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time Copilot posts comments to the pull request. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from Copilot for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by GitHub Actions or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.

When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from Copilot until your quota resets—unless you upgrade your Copilot plan or enable additional premium requests.

Two types of Copilot code review are available:

*   **Review selection:** Highlight code and ask for an initial review _(only available in VS Code)_
*   **Review changes:** Request a deeper review of all your changes _(available in VS Code and the GitHub website)_

This version of the article relates to Copilot code review on the GitHub website. To see information about the review selection type of Copilot code review, click the "Visual Studio Code" tool switcher at the top of the page.

### [Availability](#availability)

Copilot code review on the GitHub website is a premium feature, available with the Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise plans.

### [Code review monthly quota](#code-review-monthly-quota-1)

The **review changes** type of Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota.

When you assign Copilot as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time Copilot posts comments to the pull request. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from Copilot for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by GitHub Actions or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.

When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from Copilot until your quota resets—unless you upgrade your Copilot plan or enable additional premium requests.

### [Language support](#language-support)

Copilot code review on the GitHub website supports all languages.

### [Validating Copilot code reviews](#validating-copilot-code-reviews)

Warning

Copilot isn't guaranteed to spot all problems or issues in a pull request, and sometimes it will make mistakes. Always validate Copilot's feedback carefully, and supplement Copilot's feedback with a human review.

For more information, see [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-code-review).

## [Requesting a review from Copilot](#requesting-a-review-from-copilot)

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in the GitHub website. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

### [Requesting a pull request review from Copilot](#requesting-a-pull-request-review-from-copilot)

1.  On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.
    
2.  Open the **Reviewers** menu, then select **Copilot**.
    
    ![Screenshot of selecting 'Copilot' from the 'Reviewers' menu.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33497/images/help/copilot/code-review/request-review@2x.png)
    
3.  Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.
    
4.  Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.
    
    ![Screenshot of a code review left by Copilot.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-132888/images/help/copilot/code-review/review-comment@2x.png)
    
    Copilot always leaves a "Comment" review, not an "Approve" review or a "Request changes" review. This means that Copilot's reviews do not count toward required approvals for the pull request, and Copilot's reviews will not block merging changes. For more details, see [Approving a pull request with required reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews).
    
5.  Copilot's review comments behave like review comments from humans. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.
    
    Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments will be visible to humans, but they won't be visible to Copilot, and Copilot won't reply.

## [Working with suggested changes provided by Copilot](#working-with-suggested-changes-provided-by-copilot)

Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

If you're happy with the changes, you can accept a single suggestion from Copilot and commit it, or accept a group of suggestions together in a single commit. For more information, see [Incorporating feedback in your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request).

If you want to validate Copilot's suggested changes (for example by running automated tests or your linter), or if you want to make modifications before committing the suggested changes, click the **Open in Workspace** button. For more information, see [Using Copilot to help you work on a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/using-copilot-to-help-you-work-on-a-pull-request).

## [Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews](#providing-feedback-on-copilots-reviews)

You can provide feedback on Copilot's comments directly within each comment. We use this information to improve the product and the quality of Copilot's suggestions.

1.  On a pull request review comment from Copilot, click the thumbs up (👍) or thumbs down (👎) button.
    
    ![Screenshot showing a Copilot code review comment with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19709/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-controls@2x.png)
    
2.  If you click the thumbs down button, you're asked to provide additional information. You can, optionally, pick the reason for your negative feedback and leave a comment before clicking **Submit feedback**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the form for providing additional information when you give negative feedback on a comment from Copilot.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-90167/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-modal@2x.png)

## [Requesting a re-review from Copilot](#requesting-a-re-review-from-copilot)

When you push changes to a pull request that Copilot has reviewed, it won't automatically re-review your changes.

To request a re-review from Copilot, click the button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu. For more information, see [Requesting a pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

Note

When re-reviewing a pull request, Copilot may repeat the same comments again, even if they have been dismissed with the "Resolve conversation" button or downvoted with the thumbs down (👎) button.

## [Enabling automatic reviews](#enabling-automatic-reviews)

By default, you manually request a review from Copilot on each pull request, in the same way you would request a review from a human. However, you can set up Copilot to automatically review all pull requests. See [Configuring automatic code review by Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-automatic-code-review-by-copilot).

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-custom-instructions)

Customize Copilot code review behavior by adding a repository custom instructions file. To do this, create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository and add natural language text that you want Copilot to consider when reviewing code. This is the same `copilot-instructions.md` used by Copilot Chat. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).

To enable or disable custom instructions for code review, go to your repository’s settings, then navigate to **Code Review** under **Copilot**, and toggle the “Use custom instructions when reviewing pull requests” option.

### [Example](#example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, follow our internal security checklist.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with coding guidelines](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-coding-guidelines)

Note

The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.

When using Copilot code review to review changes in Visual Studio Code or the GitHub website, you can customize Copilot's review with custom coding guidelines written in natural language. Copilot will give feedback based on your coding guidelines when it reviews your code. For more information, see [Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-coding-guidelines).

Comments generated based on a coding guideline will include a message, highlighting their source.

# Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review - GitHub Docs

Learn how to customize Copilot code review with custom coding guidelines.

Note

The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.

## [About coding guidelines](#about-coding-guidelines)

You can customize Copilot code review with custom coding guidelines written in natural language. For more information on Copilot code review, see [Using GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review).

With coding guidelines, Copilot can give feedback based on your organization's specific coding style and best practices.

Because Copilot code review is powered by a large language model, it can help with enforcing coding guidelines that are not covered by your linter or static analysis tool.

Coding guidelines are configured at the repository level. You can create and enable up to 6 coding guidelines per repository.

Note

*   Coding guidelines only work with languages supported by Copilot code review. For a list of supported languages, see [Using GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review#supported-programming-languages).
*   Coding guidelines only apply to code reviews carried out by Copilot. The guidelines do not affect Copilot code completion suggestions, or code suggested in Copilot Chat responses.

## [Dos and don'ts for coding guidelines](#dos-and-donts-for-coding-guidelines)

*   **Do** use simple, clear and concise language to describe your coding guideline.
*   **Do** be as specific as possible about what Copilot should look for - that is, what you do or don't want to see in your code.
*   **Do** take a look at the [Coding guidelines examples](#coding-guidelines-examples) below for some inspiration.
*   **Don't** try to use coding guidelines to enforce style guidelines that can be covered by your linter or static analysis tool.
*   **Don't** use wording that is ambiguous or could be interpreted in different ways.
*   **Don't** try to fit multiple different ideas into a single coding guideline.

## [Creating a coding guideline](#creating-a-coding-guideline)

1.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    
2.  Under your repository name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Settings" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-28260/images/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)
    
3.  In the "Code & automation" section of the sidebar, click **Copilot**, then **Code review**.
    
4.  Click **Create guideline**.
    
5.  Under "Name," give the coding guideline a name.
    
6.  Under "Description," provide a description of the coding guideline up to 600 characters long. This will be used by Copilot to understand your coding style and to decide when to leave a comment.
    
    How you write your description has a big impact on the quality of comments that Copilot will generate. For help with writing effective coding guidelines, see [Dos and don'ts for coding guidelines](#dos-and-donts-for-coding-guidelines) above, and [Coding guidelines examples](#coding-guidelines-examples) below.
    
7.  Optionally, limit the coding guideline to specific file types or paths by clicking **Add file path** and adding path patterns.
    
    You can use `fnmatch` syntax to define paths to target, with `*` as a wildcard to match any string of characters.
    
    Because GitHub uses the `File::FNM_PATHNAME` flag for the `File.fnmatch` syntax, the `*` wildcard does not match directory separators (`/`). For example, `qa/*` will match all branches beginning with `qa/` and containing a single slash, but will not match `qa/foo/bar`. You can include any number of slashes after `qa` with `qa/**/*`, which would match, for example, `qa/foo/bar/foobar/hello-world`. You can also extend the `qa` string with `qa**/**/*` to make the rule more inclusive.
    
    For more information about syntax options, see the [fnmatch documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).
    
8.  Test your coding guideline to make sure it works as expected.
    
    1.  Click **Add sample**.
    2.  Add your own sample, or press **Generate code sample** to automatically generate a code sample based on your title and description.
    3.  Click **Save** to save the code sample.
    4.  Test the coding guideline against your sample by pressing **Run**.
9.  Save your coding guideline, and turn it on, by clicking **Save guideline**.

## [Running a review with coding guidelines](#running-a-review-with-coding-guidelines)

When you request a review from Copilot, it will automatically use the repository's enabled coding guidelines to review your code. For more information, see [Using GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review).

Comments generated based on a coding guideline will include a message, highlighting their source.

## [Coding guidelines examples](#coding-guidelines-examples)

### [Example 1: Avoid using magic numbers](#example-1-avoid-using-magic-numbers)

**Title:** `Avoid using magic numbers`

**Description:** `Don't use magic numbers in code. Numbers should be defined as constants or variables with meaningful names.`

**Path patterns:** `**/*.py`

### [Example 2: Don't use `SELECT *` in SQL queries](#example-2-dont-use-select--in-sql-queries)

**Title:** ``Don't use `SELECT *` in SQL queries``

**Description:** ``Don't use `SELECT *` in SQL queries. Always specify the columns you want to select. `COUNT(*)` is allowed.``

**Path patterns:** None (applies to all file types, as SQL queries may be embedded in code).

### [Example 3: Use `fetch` for HTTP requests](#example-3-use-fetch-for-http-requests)

**Title:** ``Use `fetch` for HTTP requests``

**Description:** ``Use `fetch` for HTTP requests, not `axios` or `superagent` or other libraries.``

**Path patterns:** `**/*.ts`, `**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.tsx`

### [Example 4: Always tag metrics with the current environment](#example-4-always-tag-metrics-with-the-current-environment)

**Title:** `Always tag metrics with the current environment`

**Description:** ``Always include a `env` tag with the current environment when emitting metrics, for example, `env:prod` or `env:dev`.``

**Path patterns:** `*/*.go`, `*/*.java`

# Configuring automatic code review by Copilot - GitHub Docs

Learn how to configure Copilot to automatically review pull requests.

## [About automatic code review](#about-automatic-code-review)

By default, Copilot will only review a pull request if it's assigned to the pull request in the same way you would assign a human reviewer. However:

*   Individual users on the Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests they create.
*   Repository owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in the repository that are created by people with access to Copilot.
*   Organization owners can configure Copilot to automatically review all pull requests in some or all of the repositories in the organization where the pull request is created by a Copilot user.

### [Triggering an automatic pull request review](#triggering-an-automatic-pull-request-review)

After you configure automatic code review, Copilot will review pull requests in the following situations:

*   When a pull request is created as an "Open" pull request.
    
    A review is not triggered if the pull request is created as a "Draft" pull request.
    
*   The first time a "Draft" pull request is switched to "Open".

Note

Copilot only automatically reviews a pull request once. If you make changes to the pull request after it has been automatically reviewed and you want Copilot to re-review the pull request, you must request this manually. To do this, click the button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu.

### [Limits on automatic pull request reviews](#limits-on-automatic-pull-request-reviews)

Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota. When Copilot carries out an automatic review, it uses one premium request from the quota of the user who created the pull request. For more information, see [Using GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review#code-review-monthly-quota).

# Changing the AI model for Copilot code completion - GitHub Docs

Learn how to change the default LLM for Copilot code completion to a different model.

*   [JetBrains IDEs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=jetbrains)
*   [Visual Studio](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=visualstudio)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=vscode)

## [Overview](#overview)

By default, Copilot code completion uses the GPT-4o Copilot, a fine-tuned GPT-4o mini based large language model (LLM). This model has been trained on a wide range of high quality public GitHub repositories, providing coverage of over 30 programming languages. Its knowledge base is more current than the default model and you may find that it generates completion suggestions more quickly.

View the list of programming languages and technologies included in the training data.

Note

The list of available models will change over time. When only one code completion model is available, the model picker will only show that model. Preview models and additional code completion models will appear in the picker when we release them.

You can switch AI models in the latest releases of VS Code with the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension.

You can switch AI models in Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 2 and later.

You can switch AI models in the latest releases of JetBrains IDEs with the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension.

## [Effects of switching the AI model](#effects-of-switching-the-ai-model)

Changing the model that's used for Copilot code completion does not affect the model that's used by Copilot Chat. See [Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat).

There are no changes to the data collection and usage policy if you change the AI model.

If you are on a Copilot Free subscription, all completions count against your completions quota regardless of the model used. See [Plans for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot#comparing-copilot-subscriptions).

The setting to enable or disable suggestions that match public code are applied irrespective of which model you choose. See [Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).

## [Enabling the model switcher](#enabling-the-model-switcher)

If you have a Copilot Free or Copilot Pro subscription, the model switcher for Copilot code completion is automatically enabled.

If you're using a Copilot Business plan, the organization that provides your plan must enable the **Editor preview features** setting. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization).

## [Limitations](#limitations)

References to matching code are currently available in JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and on the GitHub website.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

References to matching code are only generated if Copilot is configured to allow suggestions that match publicly available code. This is configured in either your personal or organization settings. For more information, see [Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-your-personal-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code) or [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#policies-for-suggestion-matching).

## [About code referencing in GitHub Copilot](#about-code-referencing-in-github-copilot)

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, then whenever a response from Copilot Chat includes matching code, details of the matches will be included in the response.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

This feature is called code referencing.

### [Code referencing for Copilot code completion](#code-referencing-for-copilot-code-completion)

When you accept a code completion suggestion that matches code in a public GitHub repository, information about the matching code is logged. The log entry includes the URLs of files containing matching code, and the name of the license that applies to that code, if any was found. This allows you to review these references and decide how to proceed. For example, you can decide what attribution to use, or whether you want to remove this code from your project.

Note

*   Code referencing for code completion only occurs for matches of accepted Copilot suggestions. Code you have written, and Copilot suggestions you have altered, are not checked for matches to public code.
*   Typically, matches to public code occur in less than one percent of Copilot suggestions, so you should not expect to see code references for many suggestions.

### [Code referencing for Copilot Chat](#code-referencing-for-copilot-chat)

When Copilot Chat provides a response that includes code that matches code in a public GitHub repository, this is indicated at the end of the response with a link to display details of the matched code in the editor.

Note

Typically, matches to public code occur infrequently, so you should not expect to see code references in many Copilot Chat responses.

### [Code referencing for Copilot Chat](#code-referencing-for-copilot-chat-2)

When Copilot Chat provides a response that includes code that matches code in a public GitHub repository, this is indicated below the suggested code, with a link to display details of the matched code in the output log.

### [How code referencing finds matching code](#how-code-referencing-finds-matching-code)

Copilot code referencing searches for matches by taking the code suggestion, plus some of the code that will surround the suggestion if it is accepted, and comparing it against an index of all public repositories on GitHub.com. Code in private GitHub repositories, or code outside of GitHub, is not included in the search process. The search index is refreshed every few months. As a result, newly committed code, and code from public repositories deleted before the index was created, may not be included in the search. For the same reason, the search may return matches to code that has been deleted or moved since the index was created.

## [View code references for code completion](#view-code-references-for-code-completion)

You can view code references in the log file for your JetBrains IDE.

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, select **Help** > **Show Log in Finder/Explorer**.
    
    The log file is displayed in your file manager. For example, for IntelliJ IDEA the log file is called `idea.log`.
    
2.  Open the log file in your JetBrains IDE.
    
3.  Search for "\[Public Code References\]."

### [Example log entry](#example-log-entry)

```
2025-02-26 09:22:12,045 [5581906] INFO - #copilot - [Public Code References] Text found matching public code in file:///Users/mona-lisa/git-repos/test-repo/fizzbuzz.js [Ln 1, Col 10] near fizzBuzz() ...:

```

The log entry includes the following details:

*   The date and time you accepted the suggestion.
*   A "Public Code References" message telling you that similar code was found.
*   The path to the file in which the suggestion was added.
*   The line and column number where the suggestion was added.
*   A list of matches, including:
    *   The license type for the matching code—or `NOASSERTION` if no license was found.
    *   The URL of the file on GitHub.com where the matching code was found.

### [Verifying the code referencing functionality](#verifying-the-code-referencing-functionality)

You can verify that code referencing is working by prompting Copilot to add some commonly used code and checking the output in the log.

1.  Create a file called `fizz-buzz.js` and open it in the editor.
    
2.  Display the log as described in the previous section.

09:24:10:525	        elif i % 3 == 0:
09:24:10:525	            print('Fizz')
09:24:10:525	        elif i % 5 == 0:
09:24:10:525	            print('Buzz')
09:24:10:525	        else:
09:24:10:525	            print(i)
09:24:10:525	```

# Using Copilot to explore a codebase - GitHub Docs

GitHub Copilot Chat can help you gain an understanding of the content, structure, and functionality of a codebase.

## [Introduction](#introduction)

If you've been assigned to work on a project that you're not familiar with—or you've found an interesting open source project that you want to contribute to—you'll need some understanding of the codebase before you can start making changes. This guide will show you how to use GitHub Copilot Chat to explore a codebase and quickly learn about the project.

## [Working with Copilot Chat](#working-with-copilot-chat)

Throughout this guide, we'll work on GitHub.com, using Copilot Chat in assistive mode, which displays a Copilot Chat panel over the bottom right corner of your current page on GitHub.com.

You can expand the Copilot Chat panel, to give more space for displaying Copilot's responses, by clicking and dragging the edges of the panel.

## [Using the predefined prompts](#using-the-predefined-prompts)

Copilot Chat comes with a set of predefined prompts that can help you get started with exploring a codebase. You can use the prompts by clicking a button in the chat panel. The buttons are displayed when you start a new conversation with Copilot Chat. The selection of prompts varies depending on the currently displayed page on GitHub.com.

1.  Open the repository you want to explore on GitHub.com.
    
2.  Click the **Code** tab to display the main page of the repository.
    
3.  Press Shift+C to open Copilot Chat in assistive mode.
    
4.  Click the **Tell me about this repository** button in the chat panel.
    
    ![Screenshot of the chat panel with the 'Tell me about this repository' button highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-37935/images/help/copilot/tell-me-about-repo.png)
    
    Tip
    
    If this button is not displayed, make sure you are on the main page of the repository and click the plus sign () at the top right of the Copilot panel to start a new conversation.
    
    A predefined prompt is submitted to Copilot and the response is displayed in the chat panel.
    
5.  Optionally, after reading the response, click the plus sign () at the top right of the Copilot panel to start a new conversation, then click **How to get started with this repository**.

## [Example prompts](#example-prompts)

The following prompts are examples of the kind of questions you can ask Copilot to help you find out about a codebase.

### [General questions](#general-questions)

*   `Based on the code in this repository, give me an overview of the architecture of the codebase. Provide evidence.`
    
*   `Which languages are used in this repo? Show the percentages for each language.`
    
*   `What are the core algorithms implemented in this repo?`
    
*   `What design patterns are used in this repository? Give a brief explanation of each pattern that you find, and an example of code from this repository that uses the pattern, with a link to the file.`

### [Specific questions](#specific-questions)

Whether these questions are useful will depend on the codebase you're exploring.

*   `How do I build this project?`
    
*   `Where is authentication handled in this codebase?`
    
*   `Analyze the code in this repository and tell me about the entry points for this application.`
    
*   `Describe the data flow in this application.`
    
*   `Analyze the code in this repository and tell me what application-level security mechanisms are employed. Provide references.`

## [Understanding the files in a directory](#understanding-the-files-in-a-directory)

Use Copilot to help you understand the purpose of the files in a directory, or individual files.

To find out about the files in a directory:

1.  Navigate to the directory on GitHub.com.
2.  Press Shift+C to open Copilot Chat in assistive mode.
3.  Ask Copilot: `Explain the files in this directory`.

To find out about a specific file:

1.  Open the file on GitHub.com.
2.  Press Shift+C to open Copilot Chat in assistive mode.
3.  For a small file, ask Copilot: `Explain this file`.
4.  For a large file, ask: `Explain what this file does. Start with an overview of the purpose of the file. Then, in appropriately headed sections, go through each part of the file and explain what it does in detail.`

## [Finding out about commits](#finding-out-about-commits)

One good way to familiarize yourself with a project is to look at the recent work that's been happening. You can do this by browsing the recent commits.

1.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    
2.  On the main page of the repository, above the file list, click **commits**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the main page for a repository. A clock icon and "178 commits" is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-48469/images/help/commits/commits-page.png)
    
3.  Click a commit message to display a diff view for that commit.
    
4.  In the Copilot Chat panel, enter: `What does this commit do?`.
    
5.  If necessary, you can follow up by entering: `Explain in more detail`.

## [Using the Insights tab](#using-the-insights-tab)

In addition to using Copilot to help you become familiar with a project, you can also use the **Insights** tab on GitHub.com. This gives you a high-level overview of the repository.

For more information, see [Using Pulse to view a summary of repository activity](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/using-pulse-to-view-a-summary-of-repository-activity) and [Viewing a project's contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-a-projects-contributors).

# Refactoring code with GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs

Leverage Copilot artificial intelligence to help you refactor your code quickly and effectively.

## [Introduction](#introduction)

Refactoring code is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its behavior. The benefits of refactoring include improving code readability, reducing complexity, making the code easier to maintain, and allowing new features to be added more easily.

This article gives you some ideas for using Copilot to refactor code in your IDE.

Note

Example responses are included in this article. GitHub Copilot Chat may give you different responses from the ones shown here.

## [Understanding code](#understanding-code)

Before you modify existing code you should make sure you understand its purpose and how it currently works. Copilot can help you with this.

1.  Select the relevant code in your IDE's editor.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  In the input box for inline chat, type a forward slash (`/`).
    
4.  In the dropdown list, select **/explain** and press Enter.
    
5.  If the explanation that Copilot returns is more than a few lines, click **View in Chat** to allow you to read the explanation more easily.

## [Optimizing inefficient code](#optimizing-inefficient-code)

Copilot can help you to optimize code - for example, to make the code run more quickly.

### [Example code](#example-code)

In the two sections below, we'll use the following example bash script to demonstrate how to optimize inefficient code:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Find all .txt files and count lines in each
for file in $(find . -type f -name "*.txt"); do
    wc -l "$file"
done
```

### [Use the Copilot Chat panel](#use-the-copilot-chat-panel)

Copilot can tell you whether code, like the example bash script, can be optimized.

1.  Select either the `for` loop or the entire contents of the file.
    
2.  Open Copilot Chat by clicking the chat icon in the activity bar or by using the keyboard shortcut:
    
    *   **VS Code and Visual Studio:** Control+Command+i (Mac) / Ctrl+Alt+i (Windows/Linux)
    *   **JetBrains:** Control+Shift+c
3.  In the input box at the bottom of the chat panel, type: `Can this script be improved?`
    
    Copilot replies with a suggestion that will make the code more efficient.
    
4.  To apply the suggested change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and JetBrains:** Hover over the suggestion in the chat panel and click the **Insert At Cursor** icon.
        
        ![Screenshot of the 'Insert at cursor' icon in the Copilot Chat panel.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-9909/images/help/copilot/insert-at-cursor.png)
        
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Click **Preview** then, in the comparison view, click **Accept**.

### [Use Copilot inline chat](#use-copilot-inline-chat)

Alternatively, if you already know that existing code, like the example bash script, is inefficient:

1.  Select either the `for` loop or the entire contents of the file.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type `optimize` and press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    find . -type f -name "*.txt" -exec wc -l {} +
    ```
    
    This is more efficient than the original code, shown earlier in this article, because using `-exec ... +` allows `find` to pass multiple files to `wc` at once rather than calling `wc` once for each `*.txt` file that's found.
    
4.  Assess Copilot's suggestion and, if you agree with the change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and Visual Studio:** Click **Accept**.
    *   **In JetBrains:** Click the Preview icon (double arrows), then click the Apply All Diffs icon (double angle brackets).

As with all Copilot suggestions, you should always check that the revised code runs without errors and produces the correct result.

## [Cleaning up repeated code](#cleaning-up-repeated-code)

Avoiding repetition will make your code easier to revise and debug. For example, if the same calculation is performed more than once at different places in a file, you could move the calculation to a function.

In the following very simple JavaScript example, the same calculation (item price multiplied by number of items sold) is performed in two places.

```
let totalSales = 0;

let applePrice = 3;
let applesSold = 100;
totalSales += applePrice * applesSold;

let orangePrice = 5;
let orangesSold = 50;
totalSales += orangePrice * orangesSold;

console.log(`Total: ${totalSales}`);
```

You can ask Copilot to move the repeated calculation into a function.

1.  Select the entire contents of the file.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type: `move repeated calculations into functions` and press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    function calculateSales(price, quantity) {
      return price * quantity;
    }
    
    let totalSales = 0;
    
    let applePrice = 3;
    let applesSold = 100;
    totalSales += calculateSales(applePrice, applesSold);
    
    let orangePrice = 5;
    let orangesSold = 50;
    totalSales += calculateSales(orangePrice, orangesSold);
    
    console.log(`Total: ${totalSales}`);
    ```
    
4.  Assess Copilot's suggestion and, if you agree with the change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and Visual Studio:** Click **Accept**.
    *   **In JetBrains:** Click the Preview icon (double arrows), then click the Apply All Diffs icon (double angle brackets).

As with all Copilot suggestions, you should always check that the revised code runs without errors and produces the correct result.

## [Making code more concise](#making-code-more-concise)

If code is unnecessarily verbose it can be difficult to read and maintain. Copilot can suggest a more concise version of selected code.

In the following example, this Python code outputs the area of a rectangle and a circle, but could be written more concisely:

```
def calculate_area_of_rectangle(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

def calculate_area_of_circle(radius):
    import math
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

length_of_rectangle = 10
width_of_rectangle = 5
area_of_rectangle = calculate_area_of_rectangle(length_of_rectangle, width_of_rectangle)
print(f"Area of rectangle: {area_of_rectangle}")

radius_of_circle = 7
area_of_circle = calculate_area_of_circle(radius_of_circle)
print(f"Area of circle: {area_of_circle}")
```

1.  Select the entire contents of the file.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type: `make this more concise` and press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    import math
    
    def calculate_area_of_rectangle(length, width):
      return length * width
    
    def calculate_area_of_circle(radius):
      return math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    
    print(f"Area of rectangle: {calculate_area_of_rectangle(10, 5)}")
    print(f"Area of circle: {calculate_area_of_circle(7)}")
    ```
    
4.  Assess Copilot's suggestion and, if you agree with the change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and Visual Studio:** Click **Accept**.
    *   **In JetBrains:** Click the Preview icon (double arrows), then click the Apply All Diffs icon (double angle brackets).

As with all Copilot suggestions, you should always check that the revised code runs without errors and produces the correct result.

## [Splitting up complex units of code](#splitting-up-complex-units-of-code)

Large methods or functions that perform multiple operations are likely to offer fewer opportunities for reuse than smaller, simpler functions that are focused on performing a particular operation. They may also be more difficult to understand and debug.

Copilot can help you to split up complex blocks of code into smaller units that are more suitable for reuse.

The following Python code is a very simple example, but it shows the principle of splitting up a single function into two functions that perform particular operations.

```
import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.formats.style import Styler

def process_data(item, price):
    # Cleanse data
    item = item.strip()  # Strip whitespace from item
    price = price.strip()  # Strip whitespace from price
    price = float(price) # Convert price to a float
    # More cleansing operations here

    # Create and print a DataFrame
    data = {'Item': [item], 'Price': [price]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df.to_string(index=False))

# Example usage
item = "   Apple "
price = " 1.25"
process_data(item, price)
```

To split up the `process_data` function:

1.  Put the cursor in the function name.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type: `split into 2 separate functions: one for cleansing data, the other for printing` and press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    def cleanse_data(item, price):
      # Cleanse data
      item = item.strip()  # Strip whitespace from item
      price = price.strip()  # Strip whitespace from price
      price = float(price)  # Convert price to a float
      return item, price
    
    def print_data(item, price):
      # Create and print a DataFrame
      data = {'Item': [item], 'Price': [price]}
      df = pd.DataFrame(data)
      print(df.to_string(index=False))
    
    def process_data(item, price):
      item, price = cleanse_data(item, price)
      print_data(item, price)
    ```
    
    Note
    
    The example suggestion shown above replaces the existing function with three functions. The third function simply calls the other two functions, and allows for existing code that calls the `process_data` function.
    
4.  Assess Copilot's suggestion and, if you agree with the change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and Visual Studio:** Click **Accept**.
    *   **In JetBrains:** Click the Preview icon (double arrows), then click the Apply All Diffs icon (double angle brackets).

As with all Copilot suggestions, you should always check that the revised code runs without errors and produces the correct result.

## [Rewrite conditional code for better readability](#rewrite-conditional-code-for-better-readability)

There are often several ways to write code that does, or does not, get executed depending on various conditions. Some conditional structures are better suited than others to particular use cases, and choosing an alternative conditional structure can sometimes make the code easier to read.

This Java method uses a series of `if` and `else if` statements to determine which operation to perform:

```
public String getSound(String animal) {
  if (animal == null) {
      System.out.println("Oops! A null animal?");
  } else if (animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Dog")) {
      return "Bark";
  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")) {
      return "Meow";
  } else if ( animal.equalsIgnoreCase("Bird")) {
      return "Tweet";
  }
  return "Unknown";
}
```

A `switch` statement might be a better way of applying the same logic.

1.  Put the cursor in the method name.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type: `rewrite the condition to use a switch and use Java 21 syntax with null case, but also add documentation and provide a better function name`.
    
    This demonstrates how you can use a single prompt to ask Copilot to make multiple changes.
    
4.  Press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    /**
     * Retrieves the sound made by a given animal.
     *
     * @param animal The name of the animal.
     * @return The sound made by the animal, or "Unknown" if the animal is not recognized.
     */
    public String getAnimalSound(String animal) {
        return switch (animal) {
            case null -> {
                System.out.println("Oops! A null animal?");
                yield "Unknown";
            }
            case String a when a.equalsIgnoreCase("Dog") -> "Bark";
            case String a when a.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat") -> "Meow";
            case String a when a.equalsIgnoreCase("Bird") -> "Tweet";
            default -> "Unknown";
        };
    }
    ```
    
5.  Assess Copilot's suggestion and, if you agree with the change:
    
    *   **In VS Code and Visual Studio:** Click **Accept**.
    *   **In JetBrains:** Click the Preview icon (double arrows), then click the Apply All Diffs icon (double angle brackets).

As with all Copilot suggestions, you should always check that the revised code runs without errors and produces the correct result.

## [Reformat code to use a different structure](#reformat-code-to-use-a-different-structure)

Suppose you have this function in JavaScript:

```
function listRepos(o, p) {
 return fetch(`https://api.github.com/orgs/${o}/repos?per_page=${parseInt(p)}`)
   .then((response) => response.json())
   .then( (data) => data);
}
```

If your coding standards require you to use the arrow notation for functions, and descriptive names for parameters, you can use Copilot to help you make these changes.

1.  Put the cursor in the function name.
    
2.  Open inline chat:
    
    *   **In VS Code:** Press Command+i (Mac) or Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
    *   **In Visual Studio:** Press Alt+/.
    *   **In JetBrains IDEs:** Press Control+Shift+i (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+g (Windows/Linux).
3.  Type: `use arrow notation and better parameter names` and press Enter.
    
    Copilot suggests revised code. For example:
    
    ```
    const listRepos = (org, perPage) => {
      return fetch(`https://api.github.com/orgs/${org}/repos?per_page=${parseInt(perPage)}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => data);
    };
    ```

## [Improving the name of a symbol](#improving-the-name-of-a-symbol)

Note

*   VS Code and Visual Studio only.
*   Support for this feature depends on having the appropriate language extension installed in your IDE for the language you are using. Not all language extensions support this feature.

Well chosen names can help to make code easier to maintain. Copilot in VS Code and Visual Studio can suggest alternative names for symbols such as variables or functions.

1.  Put the cursor in the symbol name.
    
2.  Press F2.
    
3.  **Visual Studio only:** Press Ctrl+Space.
    
    Copilot suggests alternative names.
    
    ![Screenshot of a dropdown list in VS Code giving alternatives for a symbol name.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-52618/images/help/copilot/rename-symbol.png)
    
4.  In the dropdown list, select one of the suggested names.
    
    The name is changed throughout the project.

# Modernizing legacy code with GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat helps modernize legacy code by suggesting refactors and creating tests to catch potential issues.

Note

The responses shown in this article are examples. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get different responses from the ones shown here.

Legacy code is code that is old, outdated, or no longer supported by the original developers. It can be difficult to maintain and extend because it may not follow modern best practices, such as using consistent naming conventions or writing clear documentation.

Modernizing legacy code can help you:

*   Improve performance and scalability.
*   Make the code easier to maintain and extend.
*   Reduce the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.
*   Make the code easier to test.

Copilot can help you modernize your legacy code by:

*   **Providing suggestions** for refactoring the code to follow modern best practices.
*   **Generating documentation** to help you understand how the code works.
*   **Generating tests** to help you verify that your changes haven't introduced bugs.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

In this example, we’ll be looking at an account management system written in COBOL and modernizing it into Node.js. You can find the COBOL code in the [`modernize-legacy-cobol-app` repository](https://github.com/continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app).

The account management system consists of three key files:

*   `main.cob`: The main program that reads input from the user and calls the appropriate subprogram.
*   `operations.cob`: A subprogram that performs operations on the account data, such as credit, debit, and view balance.
*   `data.cob`: A subprogram that manages the storage of the account balance.

## [Step 1: Get a local copy of the repository](#step-1-get-a-local-copy-of-the-repository)

Before you compile and run the program, you need to have the code locally. If you haven't already cloned the repository, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and run the following command:

Shell

```
git clone https://github.com/continuous-copilot/modernize-legacy-cobol-app.git
```

## [Step 2: Compile and run the program](#step-2-compile-and-run-the-program)

You can either install a COBOL compiler in your preferred development environment (for example, the open source GnuCOBOL compiler), or use Copilot Chat in GitHub Codespaces.

If you use MacOS, you can install GnuCOBOL using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

Shell

```
brew install gnu-cobol
```

If you use Codespaces or an Ubuntu Linux system, you can install GnuCOBOL using `apt`:

Shell

```
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install gnucobol
```

To compile the code, link the files, and create an executable, run the following command from the root of the repository:

Shell

```
cobc -x main.cob operations.cob data.cob -o accountsystem
```

To run the program, use the following command:

Shell

```
./accountsystem
```

## [Step 3: Explain the files and code](#step-3-explain-the-files-and-code)

The first step in modernizing the code is to understand how it works. You can ask Copilot Chat to explain the code in each file.

Open the repository in your IDE then, in the Copilot Chat panel, enter the following prompt.

### [Example prompt 1](#example-prompt-1)

`/explain #file:main.cob #file:operations.cob #file:data.cob Can you please create a high level overview of the app. It will be great if you can explain each file in detail and how they are linked.`

### [Example response 1](#example-response-1)

This is an excerpt from the response to the prompt above:

`Sure! Here's a high-level overview of the COBOL application, along with detailed explanations of each file and how they are linked together.`

`High-Level Overview`

`This COBOL application simulates an account management system. It allows users to view the current balance, credit the account, debit the account, and exit the application. The application is divided into three main COBOL source files: main.cob, operations.cob, and data.cob. ...`

## [Step 4: Chart out the data flow between the files](#step-4-chart-out-the-data-flow-between-the-files)

The next step is to understand how the files are linked together. You can use `@workspace` to create a data flow diagram for the application.

Note

The `@workspace` chat participant in VS Code and Visual Studio provides Copilot with context about all of the code in your workspace. You can use `@workspace` when you want Copilot to consider the structure of your project and how different parts of your code interact. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, use `@project` rather than `@workspace`.

### [Example prompt 2](#example-prompt-2)

`@workspace can you create a sequence diagram of the app showing the data flow of the app. Please create this in mermaid format so that I can render this in a markdown file.`

Copilot outputs the Mermaid markup for a full sequence diagram that shows how the application works. You can copy and paste this markup into a Mermaid application to generate the diagram.

## [Step 5: Generate a test plan](#step-5-generate-a-test-plan)

Create a test plan to ensure that the application works as expected after you make changes. You can use `@workspace` to generate a test plan that covers all of the files in the project.

### [Example prompt 3](#example-prompt-3)

```
@workspace The current Cobol app has no tests. Can you please create a test plan of current business logic that I can use to validate with business stakeholders about the current implementation.

Later I would like to use this test plan to create unit and integration tests in a node.js app. I am in the middle of transforming the current Cobol app to a node.js app.

The test plan should include the following:

1. Test Case ID
2. Test Case Description
3. Pre-conditions
4. Test Steps
5. Expected Result
6. Actual Result
7. Status (Pass/Fail)
8. Comments

Please create the test plan in a markdown table format. The test plan should cover all the business logic in the current Cobol app.

Convert this to markdown syntax to insert as a new file
```

Copilot outputs a test plan in Markdown format that you can use to validate the application. To use this plan later in the process, create a file called `TESTPLAN.md` and copy the suggested plan into it. This will allow you to reference the test plan when generating test cases in the next steps.

## [Step 6: Convert the files from COBOL to Node.js](#step-6-convert-the-files-from-cobol-to-nodejs)

The next step is to convert the COBOL files to Node.js. It's important to keep the following prompt practices in mind:

*   Provide context
*   Give clear directions
*   Be specific about the outcome you want to achieve

Start by creating a temporary directory within your project, in which to save the JavaScript files you're going to create.

Shell

```
mkdir temp-JS-project-directory
```

Then, iteratively convert the COBOL files to Node.js.

### [Example prompt 4](#example-prompt-4)

`Can you convert code in #file:main.cob to node.js?`

### [Example response 4](#example-response-4)

````
Sure! Here is the equivalent Node.js code for the main.cob file. This code will simulate the same account management system functionality.

### COBOL Code:

main.cob

```COBOL
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. MainProgram.

       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  CONTINUE-FLAG      PIC X VALUE 'Y'.
       01  USER-CHOICE        PIC 9.
       01  FINAL-BALANCE      PIC 9(6)V99 VALUE 1000.00.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           PERFORM UNTIL CONTINUE-FLAG = 'N'
               DISPLAY "1. View Balance"
               DISPLAY "2. Credit Account"
               DISPLAY "3. Debit Account"
               DISPLAY "4. Exit"
               ACCEPT USER-CHOICE

               EVALUATE USER-CHOICE
                   WHEN 1
                       CALL 'Operations' USING 'TOTAL'
                   WHEN 2
                       CALL 'Operations' USING 'CREDIT'
                   WHEN 3
                       CALL 'Operations' USING 'DEBIT'
                   WHEN 4
                       MOVE 'N' TO CONTINUE-FLAG
                       DISPLAY "Exiting the program. Goodbye!"
                   WHEN OTHER
                       DISPLAY "Invalid choice. Please try again."
               END-EVALUATE
           END-PERFORM
           STOP RUN.

### Node.js Code: `main.js`
```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

let continueFlag = 'Y';
let finalBalance = 1000.00;

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

function displayMenu() {
    console.log("1. View Balance");
    console.log("2. Credit Account");
    console.log("3. Debit Account");
    console.log("4. Exit");
}

function handleUserChoice(choice) {
    switch (choice) {
        case '1':
            viewBalance();
            break;
        case '2':
            creditAccount();
            break;
        case '3':
            debitAccount();
            break;
        case '4':
            continueFlag = 'N';
            console.log("Exiting the program. Goodbye!");
            rl.close();
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Invalid choice. Please try again.");
            promptUser();
            break;
    }
}

function viewBalance() {
    console.log(`Current balance: ${finalBalance.toFixed(2)}`);
    promptUser();
}

function creditAccount() {
    rl.question("Enter credit amount: ", (amount) =&gt; {
        amount = parseFloat(amount);
        if (!isNaN(amount) &amp;&amp; amount &gt; 0) {
            finalBalance += amount;
            console.log(`Amount credited. New balance: ${finalBalance.toFixed(2)}`);
        } else {
            console.log("Invalid amount. Please try again.");
        }
        promptUser();
    });
}

function debitAccount() {
    rl.question("Enter debit amount: ", (amount) =&gt; {
        amount = parseFloat(amount);
        if (!isNaN(amount) &amp;&amp; amount &gt; 0) {
            if (finalBalance &gt;= amount) {
                finalBalance -= amount;
                console.log(`Amount debited. New balance: ${finalBalance.toFixed(2)}`);
            } else {
                console.log("Insufficient funds for this debit.");
            }
        } else {
            console.log("Invalid amount. Please try again.");
        }
        promptUser();
    });
}

function promptUser() {
    if (continueFlag === 'Y') {
        displayMenu();
        rl.question("Select an option: ", handleUserChoice);
    }
}

promptUser();

This Node.js code replicates the functionality of the COBOL main.cob file, providing a simple command-line interface for viewing the balance, crediting the account, debiting the account, and exiting the application.
````

You should review the suggested code thoroughly before using it. Once you're satisfied with the generated code, follow these steps to save it locally and complete the conversion:

1.  In the temporary directory you created earlier, create a new file called `main.js`.
2.  Copy the generated code from the Copilot Chat panel and paste it into `main.js`.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Use similar prompts to convert `operations.cob` and `data.cob` to Node.js.
5.  Create corresponding JavaScript files, `operations.js` and `data.js`, in the same temporary directory.
6.  Copy and paste the generated code into each file, then save them.

## [Step 7: Link the files together and set up a working Node.js project](#step-7-link-the-files-together-and-set-up-a-working-nodejs-project)

Once you have converted all of the files to Node.js, you need to link them together and set up a working Node.js project.

1.  Navigate to the temporary directory in your terminal.
    
2.  Run the following command to create a `package.json` file:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    npm init -y
    ```
    
3.  If your application requires external packages, install them by running:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    
4.  Start the app by running:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    npm start
    ```

At this point, the Node.js application may not fully replicate the functionality of the original COBOL program. For example, balances may not update correctly, or calculations might not match the COBOL logic.

To refine the application, you will need to:

*   **Identify incorrect behavior** by running the program and comparing it to the COBOL version.
    
*   **Work iteratively with Copilot** to adjust the logic until the Node.js program behaves as expected.
    
*   **Use targeted prompts** to debug and improve specific parts of the code, such as:
    
    `@workspace - analyze main.js and ensure account balance updates correctly when crediting an account.`

Refactoring legacy code isn’t always a one-step process—Copilot can assist in debugging and improving functionality as you refine your new Node.js implementation.

## [Step 8: Generate unit and integration tests](#step-8-generate-unit-and-integration-tests)

The next step is to generate unit and integration tests to ensure that the application works as expected. You can use `@workspace` to generate a test plan that covers all of the files in the project.

### [Example prompt 5](#example-prompt-5)

`@workspace I would like to create unit and integration tests cases from the test plan mentioned in #file:TESTPLAN.md file The node.js code is in node-accounting-app folder and I am looking to generate tests for #file:operations.js file. Use a popular testing framework and also provide all the dependencies required to run the tests.`

### [Example response 5](#example-response-5)

Copilot generates a number of tests in Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, with a full, step-by-step guide on how to implement and run them.

This is an excerpt from the response to the prompt above:

`“This test plan covers the main functionalities of the COBOL application, including viewing the balance, crediting the account, debiting the account, and exiting the application. The test cases are implemented using Jest, a popular testing framework for Node.js. Validate this test plan with the business stakeholders to ensure it meets the business requirements. Once validated, you can use this plan to create corresponding unit tests and integration tests for the Node.js application.”`

## [Step 9: Run tests and refine the code](#step-9-run-tests-and-refine-the-code)

After generating the test plan and writing the tests, you’ll need to run them and fix any failing tests. Testing is an iterative process, you may need to modify the code to resolve issues, then re-run the tests until everything passes.

If a test fails, use Copilot to help debug and refine the implementation.

### [Example prompt 6](#example-prompt-6)

`@workspace - analyze test failures in operations.test.js and suggest fixes to match the expected behavior.`

Even if all tests pass, the program may still have issues. Automated tests don’t always catch missing functionality or logic errors, so manual testing is required to ensure the application behaves as expected.

## [Step 10: Move the JavaScript project to a new location](#step-10-move-the-javascript-project-to-a-new-location)

Once the application is working as expected, move the new JavaScript project out of the COBOL directory to keep it separate.

1.  Navigate to the parent directory of the COBOL project.
    
2.  Move the JavaScript project to a new location:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    mv modernize-legacy-cobol-app new-js-project
    ```
    
3.  Navigate to the new project directory and confirm everything runs correctly:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    cd new-js-project
    npm start
    ```

Now, the refactored Node.js application is in its own standalone project folder, separate from the original COBOL files.

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

In this example, we looked at an account management system written in COBOL and modernized it into Node.js. We used Copilot Chat to explain the code, chart out the data flow, generate a test plan, and convert the code to Node.js. By following these steps, you can modernize your legacy code and make it easier to maintain and extend. Here are some additional tips for modernizing legacy code:

*   **Prompting best practices are key**: The quality of your prompts determines the quality of Copilot's suggestions. Provide clear context, break down complex tasks into smaller steps, provide examples, and give Copilot specific goals to work toward. This makes your workflow smoother and your results more precise
*   **Review the code before using it**: Make sure you understand the code that Copilot provides before using it in your application. This will help you catch any potential issues and ensure that the code meets your requirements.
*   **Validate your changes**: After making changes to the code, it's important to validate that the application still works as expected. You can use the test plan generated by Copilot to create unit and integration tests for the application.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/improving-code-readability-and-maintainability

# Improving code readability and maintainability - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can suggest ways to make your code easier to understand and maintain.

Code with poor readability is difficult for other developers to maintain and extend. Copilot Chat can help in a number of ways. For example, by:

*   [Suggesting improvements to variable names](#improving-variable-names)
*   [Avoiding sequential conditional checks](#avoiding-sequential-conditional-checks)
*   [Reducing nested logic](#reducing-nested-logic)
*   [Splitting large methods into smaller, more readable ones](#splitting-up-large-methods)

Documenting your code is another way to improve the maintainability of your code. For information about using Copilot Chat to help you add useful comments to your code, see the example prompts in [Documenting code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/documenting-code).

Note

The responses shown in this article are examples. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get different responses from the ones shown here.

## [Improving variable names](#improving-variable-names)

Descriptive variable names and parameter names make it easier to understand their purpose.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

This JavaScript code logs a message about a person's age to the console. The abstract parameter names make it difficult to understand the purpose of the code.

```
function logPersonsAge(a, b, c) {
  if (c) {
    console.log(a + " is " + b + " years old.");
  } else {
    console.log(a + " does not want to reveal their age.");
  }
}
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

In the editor, select the function you want to change, then ask Copilot Chat:

`Improve the variable names in this function`

### [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot suggests descriptive variable names.

```
function logPersonAge(name, age, revealAge) {
  if (revealAge) {
    console.log(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
  } else {
    console.log(name + " does not want to reveal their age.");
  }
}
```

## [Avoiding sequential conditional checks](#avoiding-sequential-conditional-checks)

`if...else` chains can be difficult to read, especially when they are long.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-1)

This Python code prints the sound that various animals make, if defined, or "Unknown animal" if the animal type is not recognized. However, the chain of `if...else` statements makes the code inefficient and cumbersome.

```
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Bird(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Tweet!"

def animal_sound(animal_type):
    if animal_type == "dog":
        return Dog().speak()
    elif animal_type == "cat":
        return Cat().speak()
    elif animal_type == "bird":
        return Bird().speak()
    else:
        return "Unknown animal"

print(animal_sound("dog"))
print(animal_sound("cat"))
print(animal_sound("bird"))
print(animal_sound("fish"))
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt-1)

`Simplify this code. Avoid using if/else chains but retain all function return values.`

### [Example response](#example-response-1)

Copilot suggests using a dictionary to map the animal types to their corresponding classes.

```
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Bird(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Tweet!"

def animal_sound(animal_type):
    animals = {
        "dog": Dog,
        "cat": Cat,
        "bird": Bird
    }
    animal_class = animals.get(animal_type, Animal)
    return animal_class().speak() if animal_class != Animal else "Unknown animal"

print(animal_sound("dog"))
print(animal_sound("cat"))
print(animal_sound("bird"))
print(animal_sound("fish"))
```

## [Reducing nested logic](#reducing-nested-logic)

Deeply nested structures can make the code hard to follow, making it difficult to modify or extend the logic of the code in future.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-2)

This Ruby code prints information about a user account based on three parameters. The use of nested `if...else` statements makes the code unnecessarily complex.

```
def determine_access(user_role, has_permission, is_active)
  if user_role == "admin"
    if has_permission
      if is_active
        "Active admin account with full access."
      else
        "Inactive admin account."
      end
    else
      "Admin account lacks necessary permissions."
    end
  else
    "Access denied."
  end
end

puts determine_access("admin", true, true)
puts determine_access("admin", true, false)
puts determine_access("admin", false, true)
puts determine_access("user", true, true)
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt-2)

`Rewrite this code to avoid the nested if/else statements`

### [Example response](#example-response-2)

Copilot suggests using guard clauses to handle the conditions early and return the appropriate messages.

```
def determine_access(user_role, has_permission, is_active)
  return "Access denied." unless user_role == "admin"
  return "Admin account lacks necessary permissions." unless has_permission
  return "Inactive admin account." unless is_active

  "Active admin account with full access."
end

puts determine_access("admin", true, true)
puts determine_access("admin", true, false)
puts determine_access("admin", false, true)
puts determine_access("user", true, true)
```

## [Splitting up large methods](#splitting-up-large-methods)

It can be difficult to grasp exactly what a method or function does if it is too long, making it difficult to maintain. Methods or functions that perform multiple tasks may not be reusable in other contexts. It may also be difficult to test each task in isolation.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-3)

This Java method processes a customer order and prints a message. It performs multiple tasks in a single method.

```
public void processOrder(Order order) {
  if (order == null || order.getItems().isEmpty()) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Order is invalid.");
  }

  double totalPrice = 0.0;
  for (Item item : order.getItems()) {
    totalPrice += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
  }
  order.setTotalPrice(totalPrice);

  if (totalPrice > 0) {
    order.setStatus("Processed");
  } else {
    order.setStatus("Pending");
  }

  System.out.println("Order for customer " + order.getCustomerName() + " has been processed. Total price: " + totalPrice);
}
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt-3)

`How could the processOrder method be refactored to be more useful and easier to maintain`

### [Example response](#example-response-3)

Copilot suggests breaking this method down into smaller, more focused methods.

```
public void processOrder(Order order) {
    validateOrder(order);
    double totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(order);
    updateOrderStatus(order, totalPrice);
    printOrderSummary(order, totalPrice);
}

private void validateOrder(Order order) {
    if (order == null || order.getItems().isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Order is invalid.");
    }
}

private double calculateTotalPrice(Order order) {
    double totalPrice = 0.0;
    for (Item item : order.getItems()) {
        totalPrice += item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity();
    }
    order.setTotalPrice(totalPrice);
    return totalPrice;
}

private void updateOrderStatus(Order order, double totalPrice) {
    if (totalPrice > 0) {
        order.setStatus("Processed");
    } else {
        order.setStatus("Pending");
    }
}

private void printOrderSummary(Order order, double totalPrice) {
    System.out.println("Order for customer " + order.getCustomerName() + " has been processed. Total price: " + totalPrice);
}
```

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/fixing-lint-errors

# Fixing lint errors - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can suggest ways to fix issues identified by a code linter.

It's good practice to use a linter to check your code for potential errors, style violations, or deviations from best practices. Linters can help you to catch bugs early, improve the readability of your code, and ensure that your code is consistent and maintainable.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

You have run a linter on your code and it has identified some issues that need to be fixed. Rather than fixing these manually, you can ask Copilot Chat to fix them for you.

## [Example prompts](#example-prompts)

*   Select all of the code in the editor, then type:
    
    `Fix the lint errors`
    
*   You can specify a particular set of coding guidelines for a language, such as PEP8 for Python:
    
    `Use PEP8 to fix the lint errors`
    
*   If you have a local file that defines your coding conventions and rules, you can drag the file into the chat window to add it as an attachment, then type:
    
    `Use the attached style guide to fix the lint errors`
    
*   Alternatively, you can ask Copilot Chat to fix only a specific type of lint error:
    
    `Make sure all functions use snake_case naming style`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot tells you what needs to be changed, and then gives you the corrected code. You should review the suggested code thoroughly before using it. The code that Copilot suggests may not fix all of the issues identified by your linter, so you should always run the linter again if you choose to use the suggested code.

Linting issues that Copilot can help you fix include:

*   Adding necessary imports that are missing.
*   Removing imports that are not used in the code.
*   Splitting import statements into separate lines.
*   Using method and function names that follow style guidelines.
*   Adding spaces around operators.
*   Ensuring consistent indentation.
*   Removing trailing whitespace.
*   Splitting multiple statements that are on a single line into separate lines.
*   Breaking long line into multiple lines.
*   Removing unused variables.
*   Adding or removing blank lines to adhere to style guidelines.
*   Adding docstrings to functions, classes, and modules.
*   Removing code that will never be executed.
*   Ensuring that all return statements in a function either return a value or none.
*   Reducing or eliminating the use of global variables.
*   Ensuring that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments.
*   Ensuring that comments are placed correctly and are meaningful.
*   Replacing print statements with proper logging.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/refactoring-for-performance-optimization

# Refactoring for performance optimization - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can suggest ways to speed up slow-running code.

Existing code may function correctly but be inefficient, leading to performance bottlenecks. Examples of coding that can adversely impact performance include inefficient loops, unnecessary computations, and excessive memory allocation.

Copilot Chat can identify performance hotspots and suggest refactoring strategies such as optimizing data structures (for example, using hashmaps instead of arrays), reducing redundant calculations, and improving algorithmic efficiency. It can also recommend caching mechanisms or parallelizing operations to improve performance.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The following Python code prints every 1000th prime number up to the 10,000th prime. It includes a timer, and prints how long the code takes to run as the last line of the output. The program takes several seconds to complete.

```
import time

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def every_1000th_prime():
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < 10000:
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return [primes[i] for i in range(999, 10000, 1000)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_time = time.time()
    primes = every_1000th_prime()
    for prime in primes:
        print(prime)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Time taken: {elapsed_time:.10f} seconds")
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

`Optimize this code for performance`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot suggests using a sieve function to generate the prime numbers much more efficiently. If you run this program it will complete in a fraction of a second.

Note

Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

```
import time

def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for start in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[start]:
            for multiple in range(start*start, limit + 1, start):
                sieve[multiple] = False
    return [num for num, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]

def every_1000th_prime():
    limit = 105000  # Higher than needed to ensure 10,000 primes
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
    return [primes[i] for i in range(999, 10000, 1000)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_time = time.time()
    primes = every_1000th_prime()
    for prime in primes:
        print(prime)
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Time taken: {elapsed_time:.10f} seconds")
```

# Refactoring to implement a design pattern - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can suggest design patterns that you can use to improve your code.

Code that doesn’t follow established design patterns (like Singleton, Factory, or Observer) can lead to issues like tight coupling, lack of flexibility, or duplicated code.

Copilot Chat can help you use appropriate design patterns to make your code more flexible and maintainable. For example, it can recommend converting repetitive instantiations into a Factory pattern, or using the Observer pattern to decouple tightly connected classes.

Note

The responses described in this article are examples. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get different responses from the ones shown here.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

This JavaScript code creates three `Person` objects, each with `name` and `age` properties. It then uses the name of a person to retrieve and print their age.

```
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

var people = {};

function addPerson(name, age) {
  people[name] = new Person(name, age);
}

function getAge(name) {
  if (people[name]) {
    console.log(name + " is " + people[name].age + " years old.");
  } else {
    console.log("Person not found.");
  }
}

addPerson("Ana", 30);
addPerson("Mario", 25);
addPerson("Louise", 40);

getAge("Mario");
```

## [Example prompt 1](#example-prompt-1)

`What design patterns could improve this code? Don't show me code examples.`

## [Example response 1](#example-response-1)

Copilot suggests the following patterns:

*   **Singleton pattern:** to ensure that there is only one instance of the `people` object.
*   **Factory pattern:** to create a factory for creating `Person` objects.
*   **Module pattern:** to encapsulate the `people` object and related functions within a module to avoid polluting the global namespace.

## [Example prompt 2](#example-prompt-2)

You can now ask Copilot to implement the pattern that you feel is most appropriate.

`Refactor this code using the module pattern`

## [Example response 2](#example-response-2)

```
const PersonModule = (function() {
  class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
  }

  const people = {};

  function addPerson(name, age) {
    people[name] = new Person(name, age);
  }

  function getAge(name) {
    if (people[name]) {
      console.log(name + " is " + people[name].age + " years old.");
    } else {
      console.log("Person not found.");
    }
  }

  return {
    addPerson,
    getAge
  };
})();

PersonModule.addPerson("Ana", 30);
PersonModule.addPerson("Mario", 25);
PersonModule.addPerson("Louise", 40);

PersonModule.getAge("Mario");
```

The module pattern improves code organization, enhances data privacy, and reduces the risk of naming conflicts, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/refactoring-data-access-layers

# Refactoring data access layers - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can suggest ways to decouple your data access code from your business logic, making an application easier to maintain and scale.

Hardcoded SQL queries and tightly coupled data access code can make it difficult to scale or switch databases, and they often lead to repeated logic.

Copilot Chat can recommend implementing a repository pattern or data access layer that abstracts database interactions, making the code more modular and reducing redundancy. It can also help refactor SQL queries into optimized versions, improving performance and maintainability.

Note

The responses described in this article are examples. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get different responses from the ones shown here.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

This Python code connects to a SQLite database, retrieves a user record, and returns the user data. However, it fails to abstract the database connection logic and uses a hardcoded query that's vulnerable to SQL injection.

```
import sqlite3

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT display_name FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    return user
```

## [Example prompt 1](#example-prompt-1)

You can start by asking Copilot a general question about how to improve the code.

`How can I improve this code to make it safe and easier to update and expand? List possible improvements but don't show revised code.`

## [Example response 1](#example-response-1)

Copilot makes several suggestions for improving the code:

*   Abstract the database connection details.
*   Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   Use a context manager to ensure that the database connection is properly closed if an error occurs.
*   Add error handling.

## [Example prompt 2](#example-prompt-2)

You can use the response to your first prompt to write a more specific prompt.

`Rewrite this code to make it more scalable and easier to maintain. Use a context manager. Avoid hardcoded SQL queries and tightly coupled data access code. Instead, use a repository pattern to abstract database interactions and make the code more modular and reusable. Where possible optimize the code to improve performance. Include error trapping, and make sure the code is not vulnerable to SQL injection.`

## [Example response 2](#example-response-2)

Copilot suggests splitting the code into separate files, each with a specific purpose. It also provides example code for returning a user's details.

The suggested changes implement a repository pattern and use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.

```
# database.py
import sqlite3

class Database:
    def __init__(self, db_path):
        self.db_path = db_path

    def __enter__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type or exc_val or exc_tb:
            self.conn.rollback()
        else:
            self.conn.commit()
        self.conn.close()

# user_repository.py
class UserRepository:
    def __init__(self, db):
        self.db = db

    def get_user_by_id(self, user_id):
        try:
            self.db.cursor.execute("SELECT display_name FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
            user = self.db.cursor.fetchone()
            return user
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            return None

# main.py
from database import Database
from user_repository import UserRepository

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    with Database('database.db') as db:
        user_repo = UserRepository(db)
        return user_repo.get_user_by_id(user_id)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user = get_user_by_id(1)
    if user:
        print(user)
    else:
        print("User not found or an error occurred.")
```

The revised code improves on the original in several ways:

*   The code now implements a basic data access layer.
*   The `Database` class handles the connection to the SQLite database, implementing the context manager protocol with the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. This ensures that the database connection is properly managed, including committing transactions and closing the connection.
*   The `UserRepository` class encapsulates the logic for accessing user data.
*   Values for the queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
*   Errors are caught, with details printed to the console.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/decoupling-business-logic-from-ui-components

# Decoupling business logic from UI components - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help you separate your business logic from your user interface code, making it easier to maintain and scale your application.

In many front-end frameworks, business logic can become embedded within user interface (UI) components, making the code hard to maintain or extend, especially as the application grows.

Copilot Chat can help you refactor your code to extract business logic into separate services or state management solutions. This allows the business logic to be reused across different UI components. It also makes the code easier to scale by separating concerns and reducing interdependencies, and it simplifies unit testing by allowing business logic to be tested independently from UI components.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

In this JavaScript code, the `Counter` component configures the business logic for the component and also defines UI code for using the component in a web page.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    if (count >= 10) {
      alert('Count cannot exceed 10');
      return;
    }
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

`Use Redux to separate the UI code from the Counter component in this code.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot provides step-by-step instructions for refactoring the code.

The suggested changes refactor the `Counter` component to use Redux for state management. This includes setting up a Redux store with an initial state and a reducer, defining an increment action, and modifying the `Counter` component to connect to the Redux store. Finally, the application is wrapped with a `Provider` component to make the Redux store available to the `Counter` component. This separates the UI logic from state management.

The proposed changes separate the code into five separate files.

Note

Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one described here.

### [actions.js](#actionsjs)

```
export const increment = () => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT'
});
```

### [reducer.js](#reducerjs)

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/handling-cross-cutting-concerns

# Handling cross-cutting concerns - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help you avoid code that relates to a concern other than the core concern of the method or function in which the code is located.

Cross-cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect multiple parts of the system, such as logging, security, data validation, and error handling. They can become scattered throughout a codebase, leading to code duplication and maintenance challenges.

Copilot Chat can help refactor cross-cutting concerns by suggesting the implementation of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) practices or using decorators and middleware patterns to centralize these concerns in a modular, maintainable way.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Imagine you have a Python project that contains multiple service files in which logging occurs. The information that gets logged is defined within each of the individual service files. If the application is modified or extended in future, this design could lead to inconsistency in the content and style of log entries. You can consolidate and centralize the logging behavior to avoid this being distributed across your project.

Here are three files from our example project: the entry point file (`main.py`), the log message configuration file (`logging_config.py`), and one of the service files (`order_service.py`). The example service file shows how log information is defined alongside the business logic for a particular part of the application.

### [main.py](#mainpy)

```
import logging
from logging_config import setup_logging
from payment_service import PaymentService
from order_service import OrderService
from shipping_service import ShippingService
from inventory_service import InventoryService
from notification_service import NotificationService

def main():
    setup_logging()
    payment_service = PaymentService()
    order_service = OrderService()
    shipping_service = ShippingService()
    inventory_service = InventoryService()
    notification_service = NotificationService()

    # Example usage
    payment_service.process_payment({"amount": 100, "currency": "USD"})
    order_service.place_order({"item": "Book", "quantity": 1})
    shipping_service.ship_order({"item": "Book", "quantity": 1})
    inventory_service.update_inventory("Book", -1)
    notification_service.send_notification("Order has been placed and shipped.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### [logging\_config.py](#logging_configpy)

```
import logging

def setup_logging():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                  format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

### [order\_service.py](#order_servicepy)

```
import logging

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def place_order(self, order):
        self.logger.info("Entering place_order method.")
        try:
            # In here would be the business logic for placing an order
            # ...
            self.logger.info("Order placed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error in place_order method: {e}")
            raise
        finally:
            self.logger.info("Exiting place_order method.")
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

Open the project workspace in VS Code or Visual Studio and enter the following prompt in the Copilot Chat view.

`@workspace Refactor this project by using AOP to avoid logging that has cross-cutting concerns`

Note

The `@workspace` chat participant in VS Code and Visual Studio provides Copilot with context about all of the code in your workspace. You can use `@workspace` when you want Copilot to consider the structure of your project and how different parts of your code interact. If you're using a JetBrains IDE, use `@project` rather than `@workspace`.

## [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot responds as follows.

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

> To refactor this project using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to handle logging as a cross-cutting concern, you can use a library like `aspectlib`. Here is how you can do it:
> 
> 1.  Install `aspectlib`:
>     
>     `pip install aspectlib`
>     
> 2.  Create an aspect for logging in a new file called `logging_aspect.py`:
>     
>     ```
>     import aspectlib
>     import logging
>     
>     @aspectlib.Aspect(bind=True)
>     def log_method_call(cutpoint, *args, **kwargs):
>         logger = logging.getLogger()
>         method_name = cutpoint.__name__
>         logger.info(f"Entering method: {method_name}")
>         try:
>             result = yield aspectlib.Proceed
>             logger.info(f"Method {method_name} executed successfully.")
>             return result
>         except Exception as e:
>             logger.error(f"Error in method {method_name}: {e}")
>             raise
>         finally:
>             logger.info(f"Exiting method: {method_name}")
>     ```
>     
> 3.  Apply the aspect to the service methods in `main.py`:
>     
>     ```
>     import logging
>     from logging_config import setup_logging
>     from payment_service import PaymentService
>     from order_service import OrderService
>     from shipping_service import ShippingService
>     from inventory_service import InventoryService
>     from notification_service import NotificationService
>     from logging_aspect import log_method_call
>     import aspectlib
>     
>     def main():
>         setup_logging()
>     
>         # Apply logging aspect to service methods
>         aspectlib.weave(PaymentService.process_payment, log_method_call)
>         aspectlib.weave(OrderService.place_order, log_method_call)
>         aspectlib.weave(ShippingService.ship_order, log_method_call)
>         aspectlib.weave(InventoryService.update_inventory, log_method_call)
>         aspectlib.weave(NotificationService.send_notification, log_method_call)
>     
>         payment_service = PaymentService()
>         order_service = OrderService()
>         shipping_service = ShippingService()
>         inventory_service = InventoryService()
>         notification_service = NotificationService()
>     
>         # Example usage
>         payment_service.process_payment({"amount": 100, "currency": "USD"})
>         order_service.place_order({"item": "Book", "quantity": 1})
>         shipping_service.ship_order({"item": "Book", "quantity": 1})
>         inventory_service.update_inventory("Book", -1)
>         notification_service.send_notification("Order has been placed and shipped.")
>     
>     if __name__ == "__main__":
>         main()
>     ```
>     

Copilot then tells you to remove the logging code from all of the service classes, and gives you the code for the revised files. For example, this is the revised version of `order_service.py`:

```
class OrderService:
    def place_order(self, order):
        # In here would be the business logic for placing an order
        # ...
        pass
```

In the refactored version of the project, the same logging operations are performed, but the logging code is centralized in a single file.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/simplifying-complex-inheritance-hierarchies

# Simplifying complex inheritance hierarchies - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help you to refactor code to avoid classes with multiple layers of inheritance.

Deep inheritance hierarchies, or improper use of inheritance, can lead to code that is hard to maintain, making it difficult to follow relationships between classes, or to extend them without causing breakage.

Copilot Chat can suggest refactoring inheritance-based designs into more flexible composition-based designs (favoring composition over inheritance). It can also recommend applying patterns like Strategy or Decorator to make the system more extensible without adding complexity to the inheritance structure.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The following C# code has a deep inheritance hierarchy where each class builds on the previous one. The result is a long chain of inheritance that makes it difficult to know what properties each class has.

A multi-level inheritance hierarchy like this can be difficult to understand, modify, and extend.

```
public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int EmployeeID { get; set; }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public int NumberOfTeams { get; set; }
}

public class SeniorManager : Manager
{
    public string Region { get; set; }
}

public class Director : SeniorManager
{
    public int NumberOfDepartments { get; set; }
}

public class VicePresident : Director
{
    public string Division { get; set; }
}

public class President : VicePresident
{
    public string Company { get; set; }
}
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

In this situation you might decide to use a parent `Employee` class whose properties other classes should inherit, but to avoid any other inheritance by defining all other properties separately for each class.

`Refactor this code so that classes only inherit the properties of the Employee class. All of the other properties that each class currently inherits should instead be declared independently in each class definition.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot suggests the following code:

```
public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int EmployeeID { get; set; }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public int NumberOfTeams { get; set; }
}

public class SeniorManager : Employee
{
    public int NumberOfTeams { get; set; }
    public string Region { get; set; }
}

public class Director : Employee
{
    public int NumberOfTeams { get; set; }
    public string Region { get; set; }

# Fixing database deadlocks or data integrity issues - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help you avoid code that causes slow or blocked database operations, or tables with missing or incorrect data.

Complex database operations–particularly those involving transactions–can lead to deadlocks or data inconsistencies that are hard to debug.

Copilot Chat can help by identifying points in a transaction where locking or deadlocks could occur, and can suggest best practices for transaction isolation or deadlock resolution, such as adjusting locking strategies or handling deadlock exceptions gracefully.

Note

The responses shown in this article are examples. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get different responses from the ones shown here.

## [Avoiding simultaneous updates on interdependent rows](#avoiding-simultaneous-updates-on-interdependent-rows)

When two or more transactions attempt to update the same rows in a database table, but in different orders, it can cause a circular wait condition.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The following SQL snippet updates one row of a table, then performs an operation that takes several seconds, then updates another row in the same table. This is problematic because the transaction locks the `id = 1` row for several seconds before the transaction completes, releasing the lock. If another transaction starts during this time that performs a similar operation, but locks the `id = 2` row first, so that it can update the row, and then attempts to lock the `id = 1` row, then both transactions will be left waiting for the other to complete, resulting in deadlock.

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE my_table SET value = 'Some value' WHERE id = 301;
-- Simulate a process taking 5 seconds:
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05';
UPDATE my_table SET value = 'Another value' WHERE id = 127;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### [Example prompt 1](#example-prompt-1)

You can check whether there are any problems with this transaction.

In the editor, select the transaction code, then ask Copilot Chat:

`Is this transaction good?`

### [Example response 1](#example-response-1)

Copilot tells you that "the transaction in your SQL code is generally fine," but lists some things you may want to consider: lock duration, error handling, and concurrency. It mentions that "the transaction holds locks for an extended period, potentially leading to blocking or deadlocks." The response also includes revised code that adds error handling.

In this case, you decide not to add error handling. Right now you want to address the potential for deadlocks.

### [Example prompt 2](#example-prompt-2)

Enter this follow-up prompt:

`How can I rewrite this code to reduce the chance of deadlock to a minimum while not adversely affecting performance. Tell me anything else I can do to avoid a deadlock. Note: I don't want to add error handling at this time.`

### [Example response 2](#example-response-2)

Copilot gives the following advice:

> *   **Order of Access:** Ensure that all transactions access tables and rows in the same order.
> *   **Keep Transactions Short:** Minimize the time a transaction holds locks.
> *   **Use Appropriate Isolation Levels:** Use the lowest isolation level that meets your requirements.
> 
> Here is a revised version of your code:

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Update the rows in a consistent order
UPDATE my_table SET value = 'Another value' WHERE id = 127;
UPDATE my_table SET value = 'Some value' WHERE id = 301;
-- Simulate a process taking 5 seconds:
WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05';
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

## [Avoiding non-index searches](#avoiding-non-index-searches)

Searching table columns that have not been indexed will typically result in a full table scan. This can be very slow and resource-intensive, increasing the likelihood of performance bottlenecks.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-1)

The following SQL will result in a full table scan if `some_column` is not indexed:

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE some_column = 'some_value';
-- More actions here, then:
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

Asking Copilot the following question will usually reveal the potential problem.

`How can I optimize this transaction?`

### [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot gives some advice, and mentions that the column should be indexed:

> To optimize the transaction, you should ensure that the transaction is as short as possible to reduce locking and improve performance. Here are a few tips:
> 
> 1.  **Minimize the work done in the transaction:** Only include the necessary operations within the transaction.
> 2.  **Use appropriate indexes:** Ensure that the columns used in the WHERE clause are indexed.
> 3.  **Avoid long-running transactions:** Keep the transaction duration short to avoid locking issues.

The suggested code in the response includes the SQL command for indexing the column:

```
`CREATE INDEX idx_some_column ON my_table(some_column);`
```

## [Avoiding long-running transactions](#avoiding-long-running-transactions)

It's important to avoid long-running queries and transactions, where possible, as these can severely degrade performance and cause bottlenecks for other operations. Additionally, they can consume significant memory and log space, making your application more prone to failure in high-load environments.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-2)

The following SQL creates new rows in `target_table`, containing data from selected fields of rows in `source_table` where various conditions are met. If `source_table` is extremely large this may result in a long-running transaction.

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO target_table (first_name, last_name, email, dept, role, hire_date)
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, department, job_title, start_date
FROM source_table
WHERE (department = 'Engineering' AND (salary > 95000 OR grade > 5))
  OR (department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating = 'Excellent');

COMMIT;
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt-3)

You can ask Copilot whether it's possible to avoid long-running transactions.

`source_table is an extremely large table. Without altering the table, how can I ensure this SQL doesn't become a long-running query, that blocks other operations?`

### [Example response](#example-response-3)

Copilot suggests the following strategies:

*   **Batch Processing:** Process the data in smaller batches instead of a single large transaction. This can be done using a loop with a limit and offset.
*   **Indexing:** Ensure that the columns used in the `WHERE` clause (`department`, `salary`, `grade`, and `performance_rating`) are indexed to speed up the query.
*   **Locking:** Use row-level locking to avoid locking the entire table.

It supplies the following example of how you can implement batch processing. This SQL processes the data in batches of 1000 rows at a time, reducing the load on the database and preventing long-running transactions.

```
DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 1000;
DECLARE @Offset INT = 0;
DECLARE @RowCount INT;

SET @RowCount = @BatchSize;

WHILE @RowCount = @BatchSize
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    INSERT INTO target_table (first_name, last_name, email, dept, role, hire_date)
    SELECT first_name, last_name, email, department, job_title, start_date
    FROM source_table
    WHERE (department = 'Engineering' AND salary > 95000)
       OR (department = 'Engineering' AND years_of_experience > 5)
       OR (department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating = 'Excellent');
    ORDER BY primary_key_column
    OFFSET @Offset ROWS FETCH NEXT @BatchSize ROWS ONLY;

    SET @RowCount = @@ROWCOUNT;
    SET @Offset = @Offset + @BatchSize;

    COMMIT;
END;
```

Copilot tells you to replace `primary_key_column` in the suggested code with the name of the actual primary key column of `source_table`.

## [Avoiding data integrity issues](#avoiding-data-integrity-issues)

It's important that the information in your databases remains accurate, consistent, and complete. Poorly designed queries can result in missing or incorrect data.

### [Example scenario](#example-scenario-3)

The following SQL transaction deletes an employee record and creates a deletion log. However, it's possible for the `DELETE` operation to succeed and the `INSERT` operation to fail, in which case there is no log record for the deletion.

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 101;

INSERT INTO deletion_log (employee_id, deletion_date, reason)
VALUES (101, GETDATE(), 'Voluntary Resignation');

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### [Example prompt](#example-prompt-4)

`How can I ensure that the DELETE and INSERT operations are only performed if both succeed?`

Copilot tells you that you achieve this by using a transaction with error handling. It gives the following example using SQL Server's `TRY...CATCH` construct:

```
BEGIN TRY
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = 101;

    INSERT INTO deletion_log (employee_id, deletion_date, reason)
    VALUES (101, GETDATE(), 'Voluntary Resignation');

    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
    -- Handle the error, e.g., log it or re-throw
    DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000);
    DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT;
    DECLARE @ErrorState INT;

    SELECT
        @ErrorMessage = ERROR_MESSAGE(),
        @ErrorSeverity = ERROR_SEVERITY(),
        @ErrorState = ERROR_STATE();

    RAISERROR (@ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState);
END CATCH;
```

The suggested code ensures that if either the `DELETE` or `INSERT` operation fails, the transaction is rolled back and no changes are made to the database.

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/refactoring-code/translating-code-to-a-different-programming-language

# Translating code to a different programming language - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help you rewrite code to perform the same operations but in a different programming language.

There are many reasons why you might want to move code from one programming language to another. Each programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you might want to take advantage of features that are available in another language. For example, you might want to move code to a language that has better performance, or which uses strong typing to help prevent bugs.

For ease of maintaining code, you might want to move code to a language that is more widely used in your organization. For example, if few people in your organization know an older language such as Perl, you might want to move any Perl code that's still in use to a more commonly used language such as Python or JavaScript.

Copilot can help you translate code from one language to another. Translating a standalone file, such as a script, is straightforward. This process is described in this article.

Translating a project containing multiple files is a more complex process, and is described in [Using Copilot to migrate a project to another programming language](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/guides-on-using-github-copilot/using-copilot-to-migrate-a-project).

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The following Perl script prompts the user to enter the path to a text file. It checks what the user enters and if a text file is found at that path, it outputs a word count and character count for the contents of the file.

Perl

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Spec;
use File::Basename;

print "Please enter the path to a local text file: ";
chomp(my $file_path = <STDIN>);

if ($file_path =~ /[`|;&<>(){}\[\]]/ || !File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute($file_path) && dirname($file_path) ne '.') {
    die "Invalid file path. Please provide a valid path.\n";
}
if (!-e $file_path) {
    die "File not found. Please provide an existing file path.\n";
}

open(my $fh, '<', $file_path) or die "Could not open file '$file_path': $!\n";

my $is_binary = 0;
while (read($fh, my $buffer, 1024)) {
    if ($buffer =~ /[^\x09\x0A\x0D\x20-\x7E]/) {
        $is_binary = 1;
        last;
    }
}
close($fh);

if ($is_binary) {
    die "The file '$file_path' is a binary file. Please provide a text file.\n";
}

open($fh, '<', $file_path) or die "Could not open file '$file_path': $!\n";
my $content = do { local $/; <$fh> };
close($fh);

my $word_count = scalar(split /\s+/, $content);
my $char_count = length($content);

print "The file '$file_path' contains $word_count words and $char_count characters.\n";
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

`Tell me how I can convert this Perl script to Typescript. The functionality and output of the new script should be exactly the same as the existing one. Also tell me how to run the new file using Node.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Copilot generates the following Typescript code.

Note

Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

TypeScript

```
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as readline from 'readline';

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

rl.question('Please enter the path to a local text file: ', (filePath) => {
    rl.close();

    if (/[`|;&<>(){}\[\]]/.test(filePath) || (!path.isAbsolute(filePath) && path.dirname(filePath) !== '.')) {
        console.error('Invalid file path. Please provide a valid path.');
        process.exit(1);
    }

    if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
        console.error('File not found. Please provide an existing file path.');
        process.exit(1);
    }

    const fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
    const isBinary = fileBuffer.some(byte => byte < 9 || (byte > 13 && byte < 32) || byte > 126);

    if (isBinary) {
        console.error(`The file '${filePath}' is a binary file. Please provide a text file.`);
        process.exit(1);
    }

    const content = fileBuffer.toString('utf-8');
    const wordCount = content.split(/\s+/).length;
    const charCount = content.length;

    console.log(`The file '${filePath}' contains ${wordCount} words and ${charCount} characters.`);
});
```

Save this file as `wordcount.ts`.

Copilot goes on to explain how to run the new file using Node.

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you don't have it already, download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
    
2.  **Install TypeScript:**
    
    ```
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
    
3.  **Compile the TypeScript code:**
    
    ```
    tsc wordcount.ts
    ```
    
    This will create a `wordcount.js` file in the same directory.
    
4.  **Run the JavaScript file with Node.js:**
    
    ```
    node wordcount.js
    ```

# Documenting legacy code - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with documenting legacy code.

Working with legacy code can be challenging for developers, especially when the code is complex or not well-documented. In such cases, it can be helpful to use Copilot Chat to explain unclear or complex code to other developers or to document it for future reference.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The block of COBOL below connects to a database and inserts a record. The code lacks documentation, which makes it difficult to understand what it does and how it works.

```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

We can use a simple prompt to ask Copilot Chat to document the code.

`Document this code`

Note

If you want the documentation generated in another format like Markdown, you can specify the desired output format in the prompt. For example: `Document this code in Markdown`.

## [Example response](#example-response)

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/documenting-code/explaining-legacy-code

# Explaining legacy code - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with explaining unfamiliar code.

One of the biggest challenges with legacy code is helping developers understand it who aren't familiar with the languages or frameworks. With Copilot Chat, you can explain the background you have and ask for an explanation.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Consider the following COBOL code. If you're a Python developer (as an example), you might not be familiar with COBOL, so you could ask Copilot Chat to explain the code to you.

```
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. INSERT-RECORD.

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.

        INSERT INTO persons (id, name, age)
        VALUES (:PERSON-ID, :PERSON-NAME, :PERSON-AGE)
    END-EXEC

    IF SQLCODE = 0
        EXEC SQL COMMIT END-EXEC
        SET SUCCESS TO TRUE
    ELSE

        DISPLAY WS-ERROR-MSG
    END-IF
    .
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

You can ask for an explanation of the COBOL code from the point of view of a Python developer.

`I'm a Python developer. Help me better understand this code. Please provide analogies.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot provides a high-level overview of the code, before walking through the various operations and explaining them in a way that Python developers can understand. It uses analogies to make the explanation more accessible. The response might start with the following:

```
Let me explain this COBOL code using Python analogies:

High-Level Overview
This is similar to a Python function that inserts a person's record into a database with error handling.
```

```
# In Python, the COBOL divisions would be like:

# IDENTIFICATION DIVISION = module/file name
# PROGRAM-ID = function name
def insert_record():
    pass

# DATA DIVISION would be like declaring these variables:
class WorkingStorage:
    db_status = ""  # WS-DB-STATUS
    sqlcode = 0     # WS-SQLCODE
    error_msg = ""  # WS-ERROR-MSG

# LINKAGE SECTION is like function parameters
class PersonRecord:
    def __init__(self, person_id: int, person_name: str, person_age: int):
        self.person_id = person_id    # PERSON-ID
        self.person_name = person_name # PERSON-NAME
        self.person_age = person_age   # PERSON-AGE
        self.success = False          # LS-RESULT

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/documenting-code/explaining-complex-algorithms-or-logic

# Explaining complex algorithms or logic - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help add clear and concise documentation on complex algorithms or logic.

There may be times where you need to explain complex algorithms or logic in your code. This can be challenging, especially when you're trying to make it understandable to others. Copilot Chat can help you with this task by providing you with suggestions on how to explain the algorithm or logic in a clear and concise manner.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

In the C# code below, we have a method which fetches data, retries if there's an error, and updates a status label. You might want to explain, in comments in the code, how the method works and how it handles retries and cancellations.

```
private static readonly HttpClient _client = new HttpClient();

public async Task<string> FetchDataFromApiWithRetryAsync(string apiUrl, CancellationToken cancellationToken, int maxRetries, int cancellationDelay, Label statusLabel)
{
    var retryCount = 0;

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/documenting-code/syncing-documentation-with-code-changes

# Syncing documentation with code changes - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with keeping code documentation up-to-date.

It can be difficult to keep documentation up to date with changes to code. However, good documentation is essential for maintaining codebases and ensuring that developers can work effectively with the code. Copilot Chat can assist in updating existing code documentation.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Imagine a scenario where you have a TypeScript function that retrieves products by category name, but the documentation is out of date.

```
/**
 * Retrieves all products belonging to a specific category.
 *
 * @param categoryId - The unique identifier of the product category
 * @returns Promise that resolves to an array of Product objects
 *
 * @example
 * const products = await getByCategoryName(5);
 * // Returns: [{id: 1, name: "Product 1", categoryId: 5}, ...]
 *
 * @throws {PrismaClientKnownRequestError} If database query fails
 * @see {@link https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany}
 */
async getByCategoryName(categoryId: number, page = 1, pageSize = 10): Promise<Products[]> {
  return await prisma.products.findMany({
    where: { categoryId },
    skip: (page - 1) * pageSize,
    take: pageSize,
    include: {
      reviews: {
        orderBy: { date: 'desc' },
        take: 5,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

You can ask Copilot Chat to update the documentation according to the current code.

`Update the existing documentation for the getByCategoryName function to reflect the current implementation.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot explains it will create the updated documentation for the `getByCategoryName` function. It then provides the updated documentation, which now includes the `page` and `pageSize` parameters, as well as the `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` error that can be thrown.

For example:

```
/**
 * Retrieves all products belonging to a specific category with pagination and recent reviews.
 *
 * @param categoryId - The unique identifier of the product category
 * @param page - The page number for pagination (default: 1)
 * @param pageSize - Number of products per page (default: 10)
 * @returns Promise that resolves to an array of Product objects with their 5 most recent reviews
 *
 * @example
 * const products = await getByCategoryName(5, 2, 20);
 * // Returns: [{id: 1, name: "Product 1", categoryId: 5, reviews: [...5 recent reviews]}, ...]
 *
 * @throws {PrismaClientKnownRequestError} If database query fails
 * @see {@link https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany}
 */
```

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/testing-code/generate-unit-tests

# Generate unit tests - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with generating unit tests for a function.

A good suite of unit tests is critical to the success of any project. However, writing these tests can be time-consuming and are often neglected. Copilot Chat can help generate these tests for you.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Imagine you have a Python function which validates data before updating the database. You need to create unit tests to ensure the validation performs the way you expect. You can ask Copilot Chat to generate these tests for you.

```
def validate_price(price: float):
  if price <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Price must be greater than 0")
  if price > 1000:
    raise ValueError("Price must be less than or equal to 1000")
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

`/tests Generate unit tests for this function. Validate both success and failure, and include edge cases.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

If this is your first time asking Copilot Chat to generate unit tests, it may ask you if you wish to configure unit tests for your project. For this example, we are assuming you decline this offer.

Copilot will provide a strategy for generating the tests, and then provide the tests themselves.

```
import unittest
from generate_unit_tests import validate_price

class TestValidateProduct(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_price_zero(self):
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
      validate_price(0)
    self.assertEqual(str(context.exception), "Price must be greater than 0")

  def test_price_negative(self):
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
      validate_price(-10)
    self.assertEqual(str(context.exception), "Price must be greater than 0")

  def test_price_above_limit(self):
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
      validate_price(1500)
    self.assertEqual(str(context.exception), "Price must be less than or equal to 1000")

  def test_price_edge_case_zero(self):
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
      validate_price(0)
    self.assertEqual(str(context.exception), "Price must be greater than 0")

  def test_price_edge_case_max(self):
    try:
      validate_price(1000)
    except ValueError:
      self.fail("validate_price() raised ValueError unexpectedly!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main()
```

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/testing-code/create-mock-objects-to-abstract-layers

# Create mock objects to abstract layers - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with creating mock objects that you can use for unit tests.

When creating unit tests, it's important to ensure they're isolated and not depending on external services. One way to achieve this is to create mock objects that abstract layers of your application. Copilot Chat can help you generate the code you need to create these mock objects.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Imagine a website built with TypeScript which displays a list of runners. You have a service which fetches the runners from a database, and the server-side code which uses this service. You want to test the server-side code, but you don't want to make a call to the database. You can ask Copilot Chat to generate a mock object for the service.

```
// SvelteKit example at +page.server.ts
import service from './service';

export async function load({ params }) {
  const runner = await service.getRunner(params.id);

  return {
    runner
  };
}
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

This example assumes you are using [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for your tests, but will work with other test runners.

`/tests Create a unit test to ensure the service is called correctly. Mock the service object.`

If you have an existing test you wish Copilot to use as a model, you can use `#file: path/to/test-file.js` to provide the path to the file, and include this information in the prompt.

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot provides the plan it will implement and the code text which includes the mocks.

```
import { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import { load } from './+page.server.ts';

// Mock the entire service module
vi.mock('./service', () => ({
  default: {
    getRunner: vi.fn()
  }
}));

// Import the mocked service
import service from './service';

describe('load function', () => {
  const mockRunner = {
    id: '123',
    name: 'Test Runner',
    status: 'active'
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Reset mock before each test
    vi.resetAllMocks();

    // Setup default mock implementation
    (service.getRunner as any).mockResolvedValue(mockRunner);
  });

  it('should fetch runner with correct id', async () => {
    const params = { id: '123' };
    const result = await load({ params });

    expect(service.getRunner).toHaveBeenCalledWith('123');
    expect(service.getRunner).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(result).toEqual({ runner: mockRunner });
  });
});
```

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/testing-code/create-end-to-end-tests-for-a-webpage

# Create end-to-end tests for a webpage - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help with generating end-to-end tests.

Creating end-to-end tests for a webpage can be time-consuming and complex as the HTML will be generated dynamically. Copilot Chat can help you create end-to-end tests for a webpage by suggesting the necessary code to interact with the webpage and validate the expected results.

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

Imagine a React application that displays product details on a webpage. You need to create end-to-end tests to ensure the product details are displayed correctly. You can ask Copilot Chat to generate these tests for you.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const ProductDetails = ({ productId = '1' }) => {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProduct = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/product/${productId}`);
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Product not found');
        }
        const data = await response.json();
        setProduct(data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err.message);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchProduct();
    return;
  }, [productId]); // Add productId to dependency array

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {product && (
        <div>
          <h2>{product.name}</h2>
          <p>{product.description}</p>
          <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

ProductDetails.propTypes = {
  productId: PropTypes.string
};

export default ProductDetails;
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

Note

This example uses Playwright for end-to-end testing, but you can use other frameworks like Selenium or Cypress.

`Using Playwright, generate an e2e test to ensure the product displays correctly.`

If you have an existing test you wish Copilot to use as a model, you can use `#file: path/to/test-file.js` to provide the path to the file, and include this information in the prompt.

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot will respond with an end-to-end test that you can use for your application.

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('ProductDetails Component', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Set up API mocking
    await page.route('/api/product/1', async (route) => {
      await route.fulfill({
        status: 200,
        contentType: 'application/json',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          name: 'Test Product',
          description: 'This is a test product',
          price: 99.99
        })
      });
    });

    // Mock error response for product ID 999
    await page.route('/api/product/999', async (route) => {
      await route.fulfill({
        status: 404,
        contentType: 'application/json',
        body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Product not found' })
      });
    });
  });

  test('displays loading state initially', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/product/1');
    const loadingElement = page.locator('text=Loading...');
    await expect(loadingElement).toBeVisible();
  });

  test('displays product details correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/product/1');

    // Wait for loading to disappear
    await expect(page.getByText('Loading...')).toBeHidden();

    // Check all product details
    await expect(page.locator('h2')).toHaveText('Test Product');
    await expect(page.locator('text=This is a test product')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('text=Price: $99.99')).toBeVisible();
  });

  test('displays error message when product not found', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/product/999');

    // Wait for loading to disappear
    await expect(page.getByText('Loading...')).toBeHidden();

    // Check error message
    await expect(page.locator('text=Error: Product not found')).toBeVisible();
  });
});

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/security-analysis/finding-existing-vulnerabilities-in-code

# Finding existing vulnerabilities in code - GitHub Docs

Copilot Chat can help find common vulnerabilities in your code and suggest fixes.

While they may be considered "common knowledge" by many developers, the vast majority of newly introduced security weaknesses are due to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). These vulnerabilities can be mitigated by following secure coding practices, such as using parameterized queries, input validation, and avoiding hard-coded sensitive data. GitHub Copilot can help detect and resolve these issues.

Note

While Copilot Chat can help find some common security vulnerabilities and help you fix them, you should not rely on Copilot for a comprehensive security analysis. Using code scanning will more thoroughly ensure your code is secure. For more information on setting up code scanning, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).

## [Example scenario](#example-scenario)

The JavaScript code below has a potential XSS vulnerability that could be exploited if the `name` parameter is not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

```
function displayName(name) {
  const nameElement = document.getElementById('name-display');
  nameElement.innerHTML = `Showing results for "${name}"`
}
```

## [Example prompt](#example-prompt)

You can ask Copilot Chat to analyze code for common security vulnerabilities and provide explanations and fixes for the issues it finds.

`Analyze this code for potential security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes.`

## [Example response](#example-response)

Note

The following response is an example. Copilot Chat responses are non-deterministic, so you may get a different response from the one shown here.

Copilot responds with an explanation of the vulnerability, and suggested changes to the code to fix it.

```
function displayName(name) {
  const nameElement = document.getElementById('name-display');
  nameElement.textContent = `Showing results for "${name}"`;
}
```

## https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-code-completion

# Responsible use of GitHub Copilot code completion - GitHub Docs

Learn how to use Copilot code completion responsibly by understanding its purposes, capabilities, and limitations.

## [About GitHub Copilot code completion](#about-github-copilot-code-completion)

Copilot code completions are autocomplete-style suggestions generated inline by GitHub Copilot. Copilot code completion creates the experience of working with an AI-powered pair programmer, automatically offering suggestions to complete your code. In addition, it can suggest code comments, tests, and more. It provides these suggestions directly in supported editors while you write your code, and it can work with a broad range of programming languages and frameworks. For more information, see [What is GitHub Copilot?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot).

Copilot's suggestions may be the completion of the current line, but will sometimes be a whole new block of code. You can accept all or part of a suggestion, dismiss the suggestion, or keep typing and ignore the suggestions.

Copilot code completion works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your surrounding code (relative to your cursor position) and provide you with suggestions. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### [Input processing](#input-processing)

The surrounding code from the user’s cursor is pre-processed by the Copilot code completion system, combined with contextual information (such as code snippets from open tabs in the editor) and sent to a large language model in the form of a prompt. For information about data retention, see the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://copilot.github.trust.page/faq?s=b9buqrq7o9ssfk3ta50x6).

The large language model then takes the prompt and provides a response based on the prompt. The system is only intended to assist with coding.

### [Language model analysis](#language-model-analysis)

The large language model that processes the input prompt is a fine-tuned code completion language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of code data specialized for inline code completion.

You can change the model that is used for code completion. See [Changing the AI model for Copilot code completion](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion).

### [Response generation](#response-generation)

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt and the context provided to it. This response takes the form of generated code and plain text comments, ranging from the completion of the current line to a whole new block of code.

### [Output formatting](#output-formatting)

The response generated by Copilot is formatted as “ghost text” that is visually distinct from the surrounding code and presented to the user as a suggestion. It is only added to the file/codebase if the user explicitly accepts the suggestion. Users can accept all or part of a suggestion, dismiss the suggestion, or they can keep typing and ignore the suggestions in which case the suggestion is discarded.

GitHub Copilot code completion is intended to provide you with the most relevant and useful code suggestions to augment your existing code. However, it may not always provide the answers that you are looking for. Users of Copilot are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by the system before they accept them, to ensure they are accurate and appropriate. Additionally, as part of our product development process, we undertake red teaming to understand and improve the safety of Copilot code completion. The generated code completions are also run through content filters. The content filtering system detects and blocks Copilot from outputting any harmful or offensive content, or insecure code. Furthermore, depending on the user’s GitHub settings, the filter also blocks or annotates suggestions that contain matches to public code.

## [Use cases for GitHub Copilot code completion](#use-cases-for-github-copilot-code-completion)

GitHub Copilot code completion can provide coding assistance in a variety of scenarios.

### [Generate code based on your instructions](#generate-code-based-on-your-instructions)

In addition to relying on Copilot to provide suggestions, you can use code comments to tell Copilot about the code you expect to follow the comment. For example, you could use comments such as "use recursion" or "use a singleton pattern" to specify a type of algorithm Copilot should suggest. Or you could use comments to tell Copilot which methods and properties to add to a class.

### [Generating unit test cases](#generating-unit-test-cases)

Copilot code completion can help you write unit test cases by generating code snippets based on the surrounding code typed in the editor. This may help you spend less time on repetitive tasks writing test cases. For example, if you are writing a test case for a specific function, you can use Copilot to suggest possible input parameters and expected output values based on the function's signature and body. Code completion can also suggest assertions that ensure the function is working correctly, based on the code's context and semantics.

Copilot code completion can also help generate test cases for edge cases and boundary conditions that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, Copilot can suggest test cases for error handling, null values, or unexpected input types, helping you ensure your code is robust and resilient. However, it is important to note that generated test cases may not cover all possible scenarios, and manual testing and code review are still necessary to ensure the quality of the code.

This can be a useful tool for programmers, as it can provide guidance and support for common coding tasks and challenges.

## [Improving performance for GitHub Copilot code completion](#improving-performance-for-github-copilot-code-completion)

Copilot code completion can generate code suggestions in a number of different contexts, with different performance and quality metrics. To enhance performance and address some of the limitations of Copilot code completion, there are various measures that you can adopt. For more information on the limitations of Copilot code completion, see [Limitations of GitHub Copilot code completion](#limitations-of-github-copilot-code-completion).

### [Keep your prompts on topic](#keep-your-prompts-on-topic)

Copilot is exclusively intended to generate completions that are either code-related or code itself. Therefore, limiting the context of the content in the editor to code, or coding-related information, can enhance the model's output quality.

### [Use Copilot code completion as a tool, not a replacement](#use-copilot-code-completion-as-a-tool-not-a-replacement)

While Copilot can be a powerful tool for generating code, it is important to use it as a tool rather than as a replacement for human programming. You should always review the code generated by Copilot before accepting a suggestion, and further validate it after to ensure that it meets your requirements and is free of errors or security concerns.

Important

Users assume all risks associated with generated code including security vulnerabilities, bugs, and IP infringement.

### [Use secure coding and code review practices](#use-secure-coding-and-code-review-practices)

While Copilot code completion can generate syntactically correct code, it may not always be secure. You should always follow best practices for secure coding, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords or SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as following code review best practices, to address Copilot’s limitations.

### [Stay up to date](#stay-up-to-date)

Copilot code completion is still a fairly new technology and is likely to evolve over time. You should stay up to date with any updates or changes to the tool, as well as any new security risks or best practices that may emerge. Automated extension updates are enabled by default in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, and the JetBrains suite of IDEs. If you have automatic updates enabled, Copilot will automatically update to the latest version when you open your IDE. For more information on automatic updates in your IDE, see the documentation for your preferred IDE or code editor.

## [Limitations of GitHub Copilot code completion](#limitations-of-github-copilot-code-completion)

Depending on factors such as your codebase and input data, you may experience different levels of performance when interacting with Copilot code completion. The following information is designed to help you understand system limitations and key concepts about performance as they apply to Copilot code completion.

### [Limited scope](#limited-scope)

Copilot code completion is trained on a large body of code but still has a limited scope and may not be able to handle more complex code structures or obscure programming languages. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may be more challenging for Copilot to assist. Additionally, Copilot code completion can only suggest code based on the context of the code being written, so it may not be able to identify larger design or architectural issues.

Lastly, Copilot code completion is intended to generate code and code-related output. Using Copilot code completion is not intended to generate natural language outputs.

### [Potential biases](#potential-biases)

Copilot's training data is drawn from existing code repositories, which may contain biases and errors that can be perpetuated by the tool. Additionally, Copilot code completion may be biased towards certain programming languages or coding styles, which can lead to suboptimal or incomplete code suggestions.

### [Security risks](#security-risks)

Copilot generates code based on the context of the code being written, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using Copilot to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly.

### [Matches with public code](#matches-with-public-code)

Copilot code completion is capable of generating new code, which it does in a probabilistic way. While the probability is low, Copilot may generate code suggestions that match code in the training set.

### [Inaccurate code](#inaccurate-code)

One of the limitations of Copilot is that it may generate code that appears to be valid but may not actually be semantically or syntactically correct or may not accurately reflect the intent of the developer. To mitigate the risk of inaccurate code, you should carefully review and test the generated code, particularly when dealing with critical or sensitive applications. You should also ensure that the generated code adheres to best practices and design patterns and fits within the overall architecture and style of the codebase.

### [Legal and regulatory considerations](#legal-and-regulatory-considerations)

Users need to evaluate potential specific legal and regulatory obligations when using any AI services and solutions, which may not be appropriate for use in every industry or scenario. Additionally, AI services or solutions are not designed for and may not be used in ways prohibited in applicable terms of service and relevant codes of conduct.

## [About GitHub Copilot code review](#about-github-copilot-code-review)

GitHub Copilot code review is an AI-powered feature that reviews code and provides feedback.

When a user requests a code review from Copilot, Copilot scans through the code changes, plus additional relevant context, and provides feedback on the code. As part of that feedback, it may also provide specific suggested code changes.

Copilot's review can be customized with coding guidelines, which are natural language descriptions of coding style and best practices. For more information, see [Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-coding-guidelines).

The only supported language for GitHub Copilot code review is English.

GitHub Copilot code review inspects your code and provides feedback using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### [Input processing](#input-processing)

The code changes are combined with other relevant, contextual information (for example, the pull request’s title and body on GitHub) and your coding guidelines to form a prompt, and that prompt is sent to a large language model.

### [Language model analysis](#language-model-analysis)

The prompt is then passed through the Copilot language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt.

### [Response generation](#response-generation)

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt. This response can take the form of natural language suggestions and code suggestions.

### [Output formatting](#output-formatting)

The response generated by Copilot is presented to the user directly in Visual Studio Code or as a pull request review on GitHub, providing code feedback linked to specific lines of specific files.

Where Copilot has provided a code suggestion, the suggestion is presented as a suggested change, which can be applied with a couple of clicks.

## [Use case for GitHub Copilot code review](#use-case-for-github-copilot-code-review)

The goal of GitHub Copilot code review is to quickly provide feedback on a developer’s code. This can enable developers to get code ready to merge more quickly and increase overall code quality.

## [Improving the performance of GitHub Copilot code review](#improving-the-performance-of-github-copilot-code-review)

# Getting code suggestions in your IDE with GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs

## [About GitHub Copilot and JetBrains IDEs](#about-github-copilot-and-jetbrains-ides)

This guide demonstrates how to get coding suggestions from GitHub Copilot in a JetBrains IDE. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

The examples in this guide use Java, however other languages will work similarly. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## [Getting code suggestions](#getting-code-suggestions)

GitHub Copilot offers coding suggestions as you type. For example, in a Java file, create a class by typing `class Test`.

GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest a class body in grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.

You can also describe something you want to do using natural language within a comment, and Copilot will suggest the code to accomplish your goal. For example, type this comment in a Java file:

Java

```
// find all images without alternate text
// and give them a red border
void process () {
```

GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest code. To accept the suggestion, press Tab.

GitHub Copilot will attempt to match the context and style of your code. You can always edit the suggested code.

## [Showing alternative suggestions](#showing-alternative-suggestions)

For any given input, GitHub Copilot may offer multiple suggestions. You can select which suggestion to use, or reject all suggestions.

For example, type the following line in a Java file, and press Enter:

Java

```
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
```

GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.

Now hover over the suggestion to show the GitHub Copilot control for choosing suggestions. To display next or previous suggestions, click the forward or back arrow button in the control.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to show alternative suggestions:

To accept a suggestion, click "Accept" in the Copilot command palette, or press Tab. To reject all suggestions, press Esc.

## [Showing multiple suggestions in a new tab](#showing-multiple-suggestions-in-a-new-tab)

If you don't want to use any of the initial suggestions GitHub Copilot offers, you can show multiple suggestions in a new tab.

For example, type the following line in a Java file:

Java

```
private int calculateDaysBetweenDates(Date date1,
```

GitHub Copilot will show you a suggestion.

To open a new tab with multiple additional suggestions, use the following keyboard shortcut, then click **Open GitHub Copilot**:

You can use special keywords to help Copilot understand your prompt. For examples, see [Getting started with prompts for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/guides-on-using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-prompts-for-copilot-chat).

### [Chat participants](#chat-participants)

Chat participants are like domain experts who have a specialty that they can help you with.

Copilot Chat can infer relevant chat participants based on your natural language prompt, improving discovery of advanced capabilities without you having to explicitly specify the participant you want to use in your prompt.

Note

Automatic inference for chat participants is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

Alternatively, you can manually specify a chat participant to scope your prompt to a specific domain. To do this, type `@` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat participant name.

For a list of available chat participants, type `@` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#chat-participants) or [Chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-participants) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Copilot Extensions chat participants](#copilot-extensions-chat-participants)

You can also install Copilot Extensions that provide chat participants. You can install these extensions from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=apps&copilot_app=true) and from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Chat&sortBy=Installs). For information about extensions from GitHub Marketplace that provide chat participants, see [Using extensions to integrate external tools with Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/github-copilot-extensions/about-github-copilot-extensions).

### [Slash commands](#slash-commands)

Use slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To use a slash command, type `/` in the chat prompt box, followed by a command.

To see all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#slash-commands) or [Slash commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_slash-commands) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Chat variables](#chat-variables)

To see all available chat variables, type `#` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet?tool=vscode#chat-variables) or [Chat variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-variables) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

## [Using GitHub skills for Copilot](#using-github-skills-for-copilot)

Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat, include `@github` in your question.

When you add `@github` to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:

*   Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example, `@github Search the web to find the latest GPT model from OpenAI.`
*   To specifically invoke a web search you can include the `#web` variable in your question. For example, `@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?`

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: `@github What skills are available?`

## [AI models for Copilot Chat](#ai-models-for-copilot-chat)

You can change the large language model that Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts, including premium models with advanced capabilities. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. For more information see [Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat).

## [Additional ways to access Copilot Chat](#additional-ways-to-access-copilot-chat)

In addition to submitting prompts through the chat view, you can submit prompts in other ways:

*   **Quick chat:** To open the quick chat dropdown, enter ⇧+⌥+⌘+L (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L (Windows/Linux).
*   **Inline:** To start an inline chat directly in the editor or integrated terminal, enter Command+i (Mac) / Ctrl+i (Windows/Linux).
*   **Smart actions:** To submit prompts via the context menu, right click in your editor, select **Copilot** in the menu that appears, then select one of the actions. Smart actions can also be accessed via the sparkle icon that sometimes appears when you select a line of code.

See [inline chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_inline-chat), [quick chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_quick-chat), and [chat smart actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-smart-actions) in the Visual Studio Code documentation for more details.

## [Copilot Edits](#copilot-edits)

Use Copilot Edits to make changes across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt. Copilot Edits has the following modes:

*   [Edit mode](#edit-mode) lets Copilot make controlled edits to multiple files.
*   [Agent mode](#agent-mode) lets Copilot autonomously accomplish a set task.

### [Edit mode](#edit-mode)

Edit mode is only available in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs.

Use edit mode when you want more granular control over the edits that Copilot proposes. In edit mode, you choose which files Copilot can make changes to, provide context to Copilot with each iteration, and decide whether or not to accept the suggested edits after each turn.

Edit mode is best suited to use cases where:

*   You want to make a quick, specific update to a defined set of files.
*   You want full control over the number of LLM requests Copilot uses.

#### [Using edit mode](#using-edit-mode)

1.  To start an edit session, select **Open Chat** from the Copilot Chat menu.
    
2.  At the bottom of the chat panel, select **Edit** from the mode dropdown.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Copilot Chat mode dropdown. The "Edit" option is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-44012/images/help/copilot/chat-mode-vscode.png)
    
3.  Optionally, add relevant files to the _working set_ to indicate to GitHub Copilot which files you want to work on.
    
4.  Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot Edits determines which files in your _working set_ to change and adds a short description of the change.
    
5.  Review the changes and **Apply** or **Discard** the edits for each file.

For more detailed instructions, see [Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Agent mode](#agent-mode)

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:

*   Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
*   You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
*   The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

#### [Using agent mode](#using-agent-mode)

1.  To start an edit session, select **Open Chat** from the Copilot Chat menu.
2.  At the bottom of the chat panel, select **Agent** from the mode dropdown.
3.  Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
4.  Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.

You can also directly [open agent mode in VS Code](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent).

For more information, see [Copilot Edits](https://aka.ms/vscode-copilot-agent) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

When you use Copilot agent mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using the included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. Copilot may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do **not** count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.

The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).

## [Using images in Copilot Chat](#using-images-in-copilot-chat)

Note

*   Attaching images to chat prompts is currently in public preview and is subject to change.
*   If you're using a Copilot Business plan, the organization that provides your plan must enable the **Editor preview features** setting. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization).

You can attach images to your chat prompts and then ask Copilot about the images. For example, you can attach:

*   A screenshot of a code snippet and ask Copilot to explain the code.
*   A mockup of the user interface for an application and ask Copilot to generate the code.
*   A flowchart and ask Copilot to describe the processes shown in the image.
*   A screenshot of a web page and ask Copilot to generate HTML for a similar page.

Note

The following types of image file are supported: JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`), PNG (`.png`), GIF (`.gif`), or WEBP (`.webp`).

### [Attaching images to your chat prompt](#attaching-images-to-your-chat-prompt)

1.  If you see the AI model picker at the bottom right of the chat view, select one of the models that supports adding images to prompts:
    
    *   GPT-4.1 (the default that's used if you don't see a model picker)
    *   GPT-4o
    *   Claude Sonnet 3.5
    *   Claude Sonnet 3.7
    *   Gemini 2.0 Flash
    *   Gemini 2.5 Pro
    
    ![Screenshot of Copilot Chat with the model picker highlighted with a dark orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4047/images/help/copilot/vsc-chat-model-picker.png)
    
2.  Do one of the following:
    
    *   Copy an image and paste it into the chat view.
    *   Drag and drop one or more image file from your operating system's file explorer—or from the Explorer in VS Code—into the chat view.
    *   Right-click an image file in the VS Code Explorer and click **Copilot** then **Add File to Chat**.
3.  Type your prompt into the chat view to accompany the image. For example, `explain this diagram`, `describe each of these images in detail`, `what does this error message mean`.

Note

*   This feature is currently in public preview and subject to change.
*   Available in Visual Studio 17.14 and later.

Copilot Edits lets you make changes across multiple files from a single Copilot Chat prompt

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

### [Using agent mode](#using-agent-mode-1)

1.  In the Visual Studio menu bar, click **View**, then click **GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2.  At the bottom of the chat panel, select **Agent** from the mode dropdown.
3.  Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
4.  Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.

When you use agent mode, Copilot may make multiple premium requests to complete a single task. This includes both user-initiated prompts and follow-up actions Copilot takes on your behalf. The total premium requests used will depend on the complexity of the task, the number of steps involved, and the model selected. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).

To see all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat prompt box. See also [GitHub Copilot Chat cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/github-copilot-chat-cheat-sheet?tool=jetbrains#slash-commands-2).

### [File references](#file-references)

By default, Copilot Chat will reference the file that you have open or the code that you have selected. You can also tell Copilot Chat which files to reference by dragging a file into the chat prompt box. Alternatively, you can right click on a file, select **GitHub Copilot**, then select **Reference File in Chat**.

## [Using GitHub skills for Copilot](#using-github-skills-for-copilot-1)

Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat, include `@github` in your question.

When you add `@github` to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:

*   Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example, `@github Search the web to find the latest GPT model from OpenAI.`
*   To specifically invoke a web search you can include the `#web` variable in your question. For example, `@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?`

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: `@github What skills are available?`

## [AI models for Copilot Chat](#ai-models-for-copilot-chat-2)

You can change the large language model that Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts, including premium models with advanced capabilities. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. For more information see [Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat).

## [Additional ways to access Copilot Chat](#additional-ways-to-access-copilot-chat-2)

*   **Built-in requests**. In addition to submitting prompts through the chat window, you can submit built-in requests by right clicking in a file, selecting **GitHub Copilot**, then selecting one of the options.
*   **Inline**. You can submit a chat prompt inline, and scope it to a highlighted code block or your current file.
    *   To start an inline chat, right click on a code block or anywhere in your current file, hover over **GitHub Copilot**, then select **Copilot: Inline Chat**, or enter Ctrl+Shift+I.

## [Copilot Edits](#copilot-edits-2)

Use Copilot Edits to make changes across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt. Copilot Edits has the following modes:

*   [Edit mode](#edit-mode-1) lets Copilot make controlled edits to multiple files.
*   [Agent mode](#agent-mode-1) lets Copilot autonomously accomplish a set task.

### [Edit mode](#edit-mode-1)

Edit mode is only available in Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs.

Use edit mode when you want more granular control over the edits that Copilot proposes. In edit mode, you choose which files Copilot can make changes to, provide context to Copilot with each iteration, and decide whether or not to accept the suggested edits after each turn.

Edit mode is best suited to use cases where:

*   You want to make a quick, specific update to a defined set of files.
*   You want full control over the number of LLM requests Copilot uses.

#### [Using edit mode](#using-edit-mode-1)

1.  To start an edit session, click **Copilot** in the menu bar, then select **Open GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2.  At the top of the chat panel, click **Copilot Edits**.
3.  Add relevant files to the _working set_ to indicate to GitHub Copilot which files you want to work on. You can add all open files by clicking **Add all open files** or individually search for single files.
4.  Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot Edits determines which files in your _working set_ to change and adds a short description of the change.
5.  Review the changes and **Accept** or **Discard** the edits for each file.

### [Agent mode](#agent-mode-1)

Use agent mode when you have a specific task in mind and want to enable Copilot to autonomously edit your code. In agent mode, Copilot determines which files to make changes to, offers code changes and terminal commands to complete the task, and iterates to remediate issues until the original task is complete.

Agent mode is best suited to use cases where:

*   Your task is complex, and involves multiple steps, iterations, and error handling.
*   You want Copilot to determine the necessary steps to take to complete the task.
*   The task requires Copilot to integrate with external applications, such as an MCP server.

#### [Using agent mode](#using-agent-mode-2)

1.  To start an edit session using agent mode, click **Copilot** in the menu bar, then select **Open GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2.  At the top of the chat panel, click the **Agent** tab.
3.  Submit a prompt. In response to your prompt, Copilot streams the edits in the editor, updates the working set, and if necessary, suggests terminal commands to run.
4.  Review the changes. If Copilot suggested terminal commands, confirm whether or not Copilot can run them. In response, Copilot iterates and performs additional actions to complete the task in your original prompt.

When you use Copilot agent mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using the included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. Copilot may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do **not** count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.

The total number of premium requests you use depends on how many prompts you enter and which model you select. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).

## [About Copilot code review](#about-copilot-code-review)

GitHub Copilot can review your code and provide feedback. Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code supports two types of review:

*   **Review selection:** Highlight code and ask for an initial review
*   **Review changes:** Request a deeper review of all your changes

The current functionality and availability of the two types of review is summarized in the following table:

### [Code review monthly quota](#code-review-monthly-quota)

The **review changes** type of Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota.

When you assign Copilot as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time Copilot posts comments to the pull request. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from Copilot for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by GitHub Actions or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.

When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from Copilot until your quota resets—unless you upgrade your Copilot plan or enable additional premium requests.

Two types of Copilot code review are available:

*   **Review selection:** Highlight code and ask for an initial review _(only available in VS Code)_
*   **Review changes:** Request a deeper review of all your changes _(available in VS Code and the GitHub website)_

This version of the article relates to Copilot code review on the GitHub website. To see information about the review selection type of Copilot code review, click the "Visual Studio Code" tool switcher at the top of the page.

### [Availability](#availability)

Copilot code review on the GitHub website is a premium feature, available with the Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise plans.

### [Code review monthly quota](#code-review-monthly-quota-1)

The **review changes** type of Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota.

When you assign Copilot as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time Copilot posts comments to the pull request. See [Understanding and managing requests in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from Copilot for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by GitHub Actions or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.

When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from Copilot until your quota resets—unless you upgrade your Copilot plan or enable additional premium requests.

### [Language support](#language-support)

Copilot code review on the GitHub website supports all languages.

### [Validating Copilot code reviews](#validating-copilot-code-reviews)

Warning

Copilot isn't guaranteed to spot all problems or issues in a pull request, and sometimes it will make mistakes. Always validate Copilot's feedback carefully, and supplement Copilot's feedback with a human review.

For more information, see [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-code-review).

## [Requesting a review from Copilot](#requesting-a-review-from-copilot)

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in the GitHub website. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

### [Requesting a pull request review from Copilot](#requesting-a-pull-request-review-from-copilot)

1.  On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.
    
2.  Open the **Reviewers** menu, then select **Copilot**.
    
    ![Screenshot of selecting 'Copilot' from the 'Reviewers' menu.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33497/images/help/copilot/code-review/request-review@2x.png)
    
3.  Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.
    
4.  Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.
    
    ![Screenshot of a code review left by Copilot.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-132888/images/help/copilot/code-review/review-comment@2x.png)
    
    Copilot always leaves a "Comment" review, not an "Approve" review or a "Request changes" review. This means that Copilot's reviews do not count toward required approvals for the pull request, and Copilot's reviews will not block merging changes. For more details, see [Approving a pull request with required reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews).
    
5.  Copilot's review comments behave like review comments from humans. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.
    
    Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments will be visible to humans, but they won't be visible to Copilot, and Copilot won't reply.

## [Working with suggested changes provided by Copilot](#working-with-suggested-changes-provided-by-copilot)

Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.

If you're happy with the changes, you can accept a single suggestion from Copilot and commit it, or accept a group of suggestions together in a single commit. For more information, see [Incorporating feedback in your pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request).

If you want to validate Copilot's suggested changes (for example by running automated tests or your linter), or if you want to make modifications before committing the suggested changes, click the **Open in Workspace** button. For more information, see [Using Copilot to help you work on a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/using-copilot-to-help-you-work-on-a-pull-request).

## [Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews](#providing-feedback-on-copilots-reviews)

You can provide feedback on Copilot's comments directly within each comment. We use this information to improve the product and the quality of Copilot's suggestions.

1.  On a pull request review comment from Copilot, click the thumbs up (👍) or thumbs down (👎) button.
    
    ![Screenshot showing a Copilot code review comment with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19709/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-controls@2x.png)
    
2.  If you click the thumbs down button, you're asked to provide additional information. You can, optionally, pick the reason for your negative feedback and leave a comment before clicking **Submit feedback**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the form for providing additional information when you give negative feedback on a comment from Copilot.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-90167/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-modal@2x.png)

## [Requesting a re-review from Copilot](#requesting-a-re-review-from-copilot)

When you push changes to a pull request that Copilot has reviewed, it won't automatically re-review your changes.

To request a re-review from Copilot, click the button next to Copilot's name in the **Reviewers** menu. For more information, see [Requesting a pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

Note

When re-reviewing a pull request, Copilot may repeat the same comments again, even if they have been dismissed with the "Resolve conversation" button or downvoted with the thumbs down (👎) button.

## [Enabling automatic reviews](#enabling-automatic-reviews)

By default, you manually request a review from Copilot on each pull request, in the same way you would request a review from a human. However, you can set up Copilot to automatically review all pull requests. See [Configuring automatic code review by Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-automatic-code-review-by-copilot).

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-custom-instructions)

Customize Copilot code review behavior by adding a repository custom instructions file. To do this, create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository and add natural language text that you want Copilot to consider when reviewing code. This is the same `copilot-instructions.md` used by Copilot Chat. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).

To enable or disable custom instructions for code review, go to your repository’s settings, then navigate to **Code Review** under **Copilot**, and toggle the “Use custom instructions when reviewing pull requests” option.

### [Example](#example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, follow our internal security checklist.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with coding guidelines](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-coding-guidelines)

Note

The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.

When using Copilot code review to review changes in Visual Studio Code or the GitHub website, you can customize Copilot's review with custom coding guidelines written in natural language. Copilot will give feedback based on your coding guidelines when it reviews your code. For more information, see [Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-coding-guidelines).

Comments generated based on a coding guideline will include a message, highlighting their source.

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

Note

Copilot code review is only available in Visual Studio Code with version 0.22 or later of the GitHub Copilot Chat extension.

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with custom instructions](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-custom-instructions-1)

Customize Copilot code review behavior by adding a repository custom instructions file. To do this, create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository and add natural language text that you want Copilot to consider when reviewing code. This is the same `copilot-instructions.md` used by Copilot Chat. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).

To enable or disable custom instructions for code review, go to your repository’s settings, then navigate to **Code Review** under **Copilot**, and toggle the “Use custom instructions when reviewing pull requests” option.

### [Example](#example-1)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be applied to all Copilot code reviews in the repository.

```
When performing a code review, respond in Spanish.

When performing a code review, follow our internal security checklist.

When performing a code review, focus on readability and avoid nested ternary operators.
```

## [Customizing Copilot's reviews with coding guidelines](#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-coding-guidelines-1)

Note

The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.

When using Copilot code review to review changes in Visual Studio Code or the GitHub website, you can customize Copilot's review with custom coding guidelines written in natural language. Copilot will give feedback based on your coding guidelines when it reviews your code. For more information, see [Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-coding-guidelines).

Comments generated based on a coding guideline will include a message, highlighting their source.

These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in Visual Studio. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.

To use Copilot code review, you must use Visual Studio version 17.14 or later. See the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

1.  In the Git Changes window, click **Review changes with Copilot**. This button appears as a comment icon with a sparkle.
    
2.  Copilot will begin reviewing your changes. After a few moments, a link showing the number of code review comments appears in the Git Changes window.
    
3.  Click the link to view and navigate the comments. If no issues are found, you’ll see the message: Copilot did not comment on any files.
    
4.  Copilot displays comments in your code with a summary of each potential issue. You can:
    
    *   Review and make changes based on the suggestions.
    *   Dismiss a comment using the downward arrow in the top-right corner of the comment box.
5.  To remove all review comments, click next to the code review link in the Git Changes window.

For more information on enabling and configuring Copilot code review in Visual Studio, see [Review local changes with Copilot Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-make-commit?view=vs-2022#review-local-changes-with-copilot-chat) in the Visual Studio documentation.

By default, Copilot Chat uses GPT-4.1 to provide fast, capable responses for a wide range of tasks, such as summarization, knowledge-based questions, reasoning, math, and coding.

However, you are not limited to using this model. You can choose from a selection of other models, each with its own particular strengths. You may have a favorite model that you like to use, or you might prefer to use a particular model for inquiring about a specific subject.

Copilot allows you to change the model during a chat and have the alternative model used to generate responses to your prompts.

Changing the model that's used by Copilot Chat does not affect the model that's used for Copilot code completion. See [Changing the AI model for Copilot code completion](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion).

Note

*   Support for GPT-4.5, Claude Opus 4, and o3 are only available on Copilot Pro+.
*   You can only use an alternative AI model in the immersive view of Copilot Chat on GitHub.com. This is the full-page version of Copilot Chat that's displayed at [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot). The Copilot Chat panel always uses the default model.

# Changing the AI model for Copilot code completion - GitHub Docs

Learn how to change the default LLM for Copilot code completion to a different model.

*   [JetBrains IDEs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=jetbrains)
*   [Visual Studio](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=visualstudio)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-code-completion?tool=vscode)

## [Overview](#overview)

By default, Copilot code completion uses the GPT-4o Copilot, a fine-tuned GPT-4o mini based large language model (LLM). This model has been trained on a wide range of high quality public GitHub repositories, providing coverage of over 30 programming languages. Its knowledge base is more current than the default model and you may find that it generates completion suggestions more quickly.

View the list of programming languages and technologies included in the training data.

*   C
*   C#
*   C++
*   Clojure
*   CSS
*   Dart
*   Dockerfile

*   Shell
*   Swift
*   TeX
*   TypeScript
*   Vue

Note

The list of available models will change over time. When only one code completion model is available, the model picker will only show that model. Preview models and additional code completion models will appear in the picker when we release them.

You can switch AI models in the latest releases of VS Code with the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension.

You can switch AI models in Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 2 and later.

You can switch AI models in the latest releases of JetBrains IDEs with the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension.

## [Effects of switching the AI model](#effects-of-switching-the-ai-model)

Changing the model that's used for Copilot code completion does not affect the model that's used by Copilot Chat. See [Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat).

There are no changes to the data collection and usage policy if you change the AI model.

If you are on a Copilot Free subscription, all completions count against your completions quota regardless of the model used. See [Plans for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot#comparing-copilot-subscriptions).

The setting to enable or disable suggestions that match public code are applied irrespective of which model you choose. See [Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).

## [Enabling the model switcher](#enabling-the-model-switcher)

If you have a Copilot Free or Copilot Pro subscription, the model switcher for Copilot code completion is automatically enabled.

If you're using a Copilot Business plan, the organization that provides your plan must enable the **Editor preview features** setting. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization).

## [Limitations](#limitations)

References to matching code are currently available in JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and on the GitHub website.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

References to matching code are only generated if Copilot is configured to allow suggestions that match publicly available code. This is configured in either your personal or organization settings. For more information, see [Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-your-personal-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code) or [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#policies-for-suggestion-matching).

## [About code referencing in GitHub Copilot](#about-code-referencing-in-github-copilot)

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, then whenever a response from Copilot Chat includes matching code, details of the matches will be included in the response.

If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:

*   When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.
*   When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.

This feature is called code referencing.

### [Code referencing for Copilot code completion](#code-referencing-for-copilot-code-completion)

When you accept a code completion suggestion that matches code in a public GitHub repository, information about the matching code is logged. The log entry includes the URLs of files containing matching code, and the name of the license that applies to that code, if any was found. This allows you to review these references and decide how to proceed. For example, you can decide what attribution to use, or whether you want to remove this code from your project.

Note

*   Code referencing for code completion only occurs for matches of accepted Copilot suggestions. Code you have written, and Copilot suggestions you have altered, are not checked for matches to public code.
*   Typically, matches to public code occur in less than one percent of Copilot suggestions, so you should not expect to see code references for many suggestions.

### [Code referencing for Copilot Chat](#code-referencing-for-copilot-chat)

When Copilot Chat provides a response that includes code that matches code in a public GitHub repository, this is indicated at the end of the response with a link to display details of the matched code in the editor.

Note

Typically, matches to public code occur infrequently, so you should not expect to see code references in many Copilot Chat responses.

### [Code referencing for Copilot Chat](#code-referencing-for-copilot-chat-2)

When Copilot Chat provides a response that includes code that matches code in a public GitHub repository, this is indicated below the suggested code, with a link to display details of the matched code in the output log.

### [How code referencing finds matching code](#how-code-referencing-finds-matching-code)

Copilot code referencing searches for matches by taking the code suggestion, plus some of the code that will surround the suggestion if it is accepted, and comparing it against an index of all public repositories on GitHub.com. Code in private GitHub repositories, or code outside of GitHub, is not included in the search process. The search index is refreshed every few months. As a result, newly committed code, and code from public repositories deleted before the index was created, may not be included in the search. For the same reason, the search may return matches to code that has been deleted or moved since the index was created.

## [View code references for code completion](#view-code-references-for-code-completion)

You can view code references in the log file for your JetBrains IDE.

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, select **Help** > **Show Log in Finder/Explorer**.
    
    The log file is displayed in your file manager. For example, for IntelliJ IDEA the log file is called `idea.log`.
    
2.  Open the log file in your JetBrains IDE.
    
3.  Search for "\[Public Code References\]."

### [Example log entry](#example-log-entry)

```

# Responsible use of Copilot Autofix for code scanning - GitHub Docs

Learn how GitHub uses AI to suggest potential fixes for code scanning alerts and find out how best to mitigate limitations in the AI suggestions.

## Who can use this feature?

GitHub Copilot Autofix for code scanning is available for the following repository types:

*   Public repositories on GitHub.com
*   Organization-owned repositories on GitHub Team with [GitHub Code Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) enabled

## [About Copilot Autofix for code scanning](#about-copilot-autofix-for-code-scanning)

GitHub Copilot Autofix is an expansion of code scanning that provides users with targeted recommendations to help them fix code scanning alerts so they can avoid introducing new security vulnerabilities. The potential fixes are generated automatically by large language models (LLMs) using data from the codebase and from code scanning analysis. GitHub Copilot Autofix is available for CodeQL analysis, and supports the third-party tool ESLint (third-party support is in public preview and subject to change).

Note

You do not need a subscription to GitHub Copilot to use GitHub Copilot Autofix. Copilot Autofix is available to all public repositories on GitHub.com, as well as internal or private repositories owned by organizations and enterprises that have a license for GitHub Code Security.

Copilot Autofix generates potential fixes that are relevant to the existing source code and translates the description and location of an alert into code changes that may fix the alert. Copilot Autofix uses internal GitHub Copilot APIs interfacing with the large language model GPT-4o from OpenAI, which has sufficient generative capabilities to produce both suggested fixes in code and explanatory text for those fixes.

Copilot Autofix is allowed by default and enabled for every repository using CodeQL, but you can choose to opt out and disable Copilot Autofix. To learn how to disable Copilot Autofix at the enterprise, organization and repository levels, see [Disabling Copilot Autofix for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/disabling-autofix-for-code-scanning).

In an organization's security overview dashboard, you can view the total number of code suggestions generated on open and closed pull requests in the organization for a given time period. For more information, see [Viewing security insights](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights#autofix-suggestions).

## [Developer experience](#developer-experience)

Code scanning users can already see security alerts to analyze their pull requests. However, developers often have little training in secure coding so fixing these alerts requires substantial effort. They must first read and understand the alert location and description, and then use that understanding to edit the source code to fix the vulnerability.

Copilot Autofix lowers the barrier of entry to developers by combining information on best practices with details of the codebase and alert to suggest a potential fix to the developer. Instead of starting with a search for information about the vulnerability, the developer starts with a code suggestion that demonstrates a potential solution for their codebase. The developer evaluates the potential fix to determine whether it is the best solution for their codebase and to ensure that it maintains the intended behavior.

After committing a suggested fix or modified fix, the developer should always verify that continuous integration testing (CI) for the codebase continues to pass and that the alert is shown as resolved before they merge their pull request.

## [Supported languages for CodeQL code scanning](#supported-languages-for-codeql-code-scanning)

Copilot Autofix supports fix generation for a subset of queries included in the default and security-extended CodeQL query suites for C#, C/C++, Go, Java/Kotlin, Swift, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Ruby. For more information on these query suites, see [CodeQL query suites](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/codeql-query-suites#built-in-codeql-query-suites).

## [Suggestion generation process](#suggestion-generation-process)

When Copilot Autofix is enabled for a repository, code scanning alerts that are identified send input to the LLM. If the LLM can generate a potential fix, the fix is shown as a suggestion.

GitHub sends the LLM a variety of data from the code scanning analysis. For example:

*   CodeQL alert data in SARIF format. For more information, see “[SARIF support for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning).”
*   Code from the current version of the branch.
    *   Short snippets of code around each source location, sink location, and any location referenced in the alert message or included on the flow path.
    *   First ~10 lines from each file involved in any of those locations.
*   Help text for the CodeQL query that identified the problem. For examples, see “[CodeQL query help](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/).”

Any Copilot Autofix suggestions are generated and stored within the code scanning backend. They are displayed as suggestions. No user interaction is needed beyond enabling code scanning on the codebase and creating a pull request.

The process of generating fixes does not gather or utilize any customer data beyond the scope outlined above. Therefore, the use of this feature is governed by the existing terms and conditions associated with Advanced Security. Moreover, data handled by Copilot Autofix is strictly not employed for LLM training purposes. For more information on Advanced Security terms and conditions, see [GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features#advanced-security).

## [Quality of suggestions](#quality-of-suggestions)

GitHub uses an automated test harness to continuously monitor the quality of suggestions from Copilot Autofix. This allows us to understand how the suggestions generated by the LLM change as the model develops.

The test harness includes a set of over 2,300 alerts from a diverse set of public repositories where the highlighted code has test coverage. Suggestions for these alerts are tested to see how good they are, that is, how much a developer would need to edit them before committing them to the codebase. For many of the test alerts, suggestions generated by the LLM could be committed as-is to fix the alert while continuing to successfully pass all the existing CI tests.

In addition, the system is stress-tested to check for any potential harm (often referred to as red teaming), and a filtering system on the LLM helps prevent potentially harmful suggestions being displayed to users.

### [How GitHub tests suggestions](#how-github-tests-suggestions)

We test the effectiveness of suggestions by merging all suggested changes, unedited, before running code scanning and the repository's unit tests on the resulting code.

1.  Was the code scanning alert fixed by the suggestion?
2.  Did the fix introduce any new code scanning alerts?
3.  Did the fix introduce any syntax errors that code scanning can detect?
4.  Has the fix changed the output of any of the repository tests?

In addition, we spot check many of the successful suggestions and verify that they fix the alert without introducing new problems. When one or more of these checks failed, our manual triage showed that in many cases the proposed fix was nearly correct but needed some minor modifications that a user could identify and manually perform.

### [Effectiveness on other projects](#effectiveness-on-other-projects)

The test set contains a broad range of different types of projects and alerts. We predict that suggestions for other projects using languages supported by Copilot Autofix should follow a similar pattern.

*   Copilot Autofix is likely to add a code suggestion to the majority of alerts.
*   When developers evaluate the suggestions we expect that the majority of fixes can be committed without editing or with minor updates to reflect the wider context of the code.
*   A small percentage of suggested fixes will reflect a significant misunderstanding of the codebase or the vulnerability.

However, each project and codebase is unique, so developers may need to edit a larger percentage of suggested fixes before committing them. Copilot Autofix provides valuable information to help you resolve code scanning alerts, but ultimately it remains your responsibility to evaluate the proposed change and ensure the security and accuracy of your code.

Note

Fix generation for supported languages is subject to LLM operational capacity. In addition, each suggested fix is tested before it is added to a pull request. If no suggestion is available, or if the suggested fix fails internal testing, then no suggestion is displayed.

## [Limitations of suggestions](#limitations-of-suggestions)

When you review a suggestion from Copilot Autofix, you must always consider the limitations of AI and edit the changes as needed before you accept the changes. You should also consider updating the CI testing and dependency management for a repository before enabling Copilot Autofix for code scanning. For more information, see [Mitigating the limitations of suggestions](#mitigating-the-limitations-of-suggestions).

### [Limitations of code suggestions](#limitations-of-code-suggestions)

*   _Human languages:_ The system primarily uses English data, including the prompts sent to the system, the code seen by the LLMs in their datasets, and the test cases used for internal evaluation. Suggestions generated by the LLM may have a lower success rate for source code and comments written in other languages and using other character sets.
*   _Syntax errors:_ The system may suggest fixes that are not syntactically correct code changes, so it is important to run syntax checks on pull requests.
*   _Location errors:_ The system may suggest fixes that are syntactically correct code but are suggested at the incorrect location, which means that if a user accepts a fix without editing the location they will introduce a syntax error.
*   _Semantic errors_: The system may suggest fixes that are syntactically valid but that change the semantics of the program. The system has no understanding of the programmer or codebase’s intent in how the code should behave. Having good test coverage helps developers verify that a fix does not change the behavior of the codebase.
*   _Security vulnerabilities and misleading fixes:_ The system may suggest fixes that fail to remediate the underlying security vulnerability and/or introduce new security vulnerabilities.
*   _Partial fixes:_ The system may suggest fixes that only partially address the security vulnerability, or only partially preserve the intended code functionality. The system sees only a small subset of the code in the codebase and does not always produce globally optimal or correct solutions.

### [Limitations of dependency suggestions](#limitations-of-dependency-suggestions)

Sometimes a suggested fix includes a change in the dependencies of the codebase. If you use a dependency management system, any changes will be highlighted automatically for the developer to review. Before merging a pull request always verify that any dependency changes are secure and maintain the intended behavior of the codebase.

*   _New or updated dependencies:_ The system may suggest adding or updating software dependencies as part of a suggested fix. For example, by suggesting changing the `package.json` file for JavaScript projects to add dependencies from npm.
*   _Unsupported or insecure dependencies:_ The system does not know which versions of an existing dependency are supported or secure.
*   _Fabricated dependencies:_ The system has incomplete knowledge of the dependencies published in the wider ecosystem. This can lead to suggestions that add a new dependency on malicious software that attackers have published under a statistically probable dependency name.

## [Mitigating the limitations of suggestions](#mitigating-the-limitations-of-suggestions)

The best way to mitigate the limitations of suggestions from Copilot Autofix is to follow best practices. For example, using CI testing of pull requests to verify functional requirements are unaffected and using dependency management solutions, such as the dependency review API and action. For more information, see “[About dependency review](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review).”

It is important to remember that the author of a pull request retains responsibility for how they respond to review comments and suggested code changes, whether proposed by colleagues or automated tools. Developers should always look at suggestions for code changes critically. If needed, they should edit the suggested changes to ensure that the resulting code and application are correct, secure, meet performance criteria, and satisfy all other functional and non-functional requirements for the application.

Note

If you are part of the public preview of Copilot Workspace for PRs, you can click **Open in Workspace** on a Copilot Autofix suggestion to open a Copilot Workspace directly on GitHub. Copilot Workspace for PRs allows you to view and edit all Copilot Autofix suggestions and other review suggestions for the pull request, run CI tests to confirm they still pass, and then apply multiple changes in one commit. For more information, see [Using Copilot to help you work on a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/using-copilot-to-help-you-work-on-a-pull-request).

# Configuring default setup for code scanning - GitHub Docs

Quickly set up code scanning to find and fix vulnerable code automatically.

## Who can use this feature?

Repository owners, organization owners, security managers, and users with the **admin** role

Code scanning is available for the following repository types:

*   Public repositories on GitHub.com
*   Organization-owned repositories on GitHub Team with [GitHub Code Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) enabled

## [About default setup](#about-default-setup)

Default setup for code scanning is the quickest, easiest, most low-maintenance way to enable code scanning for your repository. Based on the code in your repository, default setup will automatically create a custom code scanning configuration. After enabling default setup, the code written in CodeQL-supported languages in your repository will be scanned:

*   On each push to the repository's default branch, or any protected branch. For more information on protected branches, see [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).
*   When creating or committing to a pull request based against the repository's default branch, or any protected branch, excluding pull requests from forks.
*   On a weekly schedule.

Note

If no pushes and pull requests have occurred in a repository with default setup enabled for 6 months, the weekly schedule will be disabled to save your GitHub Actions minutes.

You can also enable default setup for multiple or all repositories in an organization at the same time. For information on bulk enablement, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale).

If you need more granular control over your code scanning configuration, you should instead configure advanced setup. For more information, see [Configuring advanced setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning).

### [Requirements for using default setup](#requirements-for-using-default-setup)

Your repository is eligible for default setup for code scanning if:

*   GitHub Actions are enabled.
*   It is publicly visible, or GitHub Code Security is enabled.

We recommend enabling default setup for eligible repositories if there is any chance the repositories will include at least one CodeQL-supported language in the future. If you enable default setup on a repository that does not include any CodeQL-supported languages, default setup will not run any scans or use any GitHub Actions minutes. If CodeQL-supported languages are added to the repository's default branch, default setup will automatically begin scanning CodeQL-supported languages and using GitHub Actions minutes. For more information on CodeQL-supported languages, see [About code scanning with CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql#about-codeql).

You can use default setup for all CodeQL-supported languages for self-hosted runners or GitHub-hosted runners. See [Assigning labels to runners](#assigning-labels-to-runners), later in this article.

Default setup uses the `none` build mode for C/C++, C# and Java and uses the `autobuild` build mode for other compiled languages. You should configure your self-hosted runners to make sure they can run all the necessary commands for C/C++, C#, and Swift analysis. Analysis of JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Ruby, Python, and Kotlin code does not currently require special configuration.

### [Customizing default setup](#customizing-default-setup)

We recommend that you start using code scanning with default setup. After you've initially configured default setup, you can evaluate code scanning to see how it's working for you. If you find that something isn't working as you expect, you can customize default setup to better meet your needs. For more information, see [Evaluating default setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/evaluating-default-setup-for-code-scanning).

### [About adding non-compiled and compiled languages to your default setup](#about-adding-non-compiled-and-compiled-languages-to-your-default-setup)

If the code in a repository changes to include Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or Ruby, GitHub will automatically update the code scanning configuration to include the new language. If code scanning fails with the new configuration, GitHub will resume the previous configuration automatically so the repository does not lose code scanning coverage.

Compiled languages are not automatically included in default setup configuration because they often require more advanced configuration, but you can manually select any CodeQL-supported compiled language for analysis.

## [Configuring default setup for a repository](#configuring-default-setup-for-a-repository)

Note

If the analyses fail for all CodeQL-supported languages in a repository, default setup will still be enabled, but it will not run any scans or use any GitHub Actions minutes until another CodeQL-supported language is added to the repository or default setup is manually reconfigured, and the analysis of a CodeQL-supported language succeeds.

1.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    
    Note
    
    If you are configuring default setup on a fork, you must first enable GitHub Actions. To enable GitHub Actions, under your repository name, click **Actions**, then click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**. Be aware that this will enable all existing workflows on your fork.
    
2.  Under your repository name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Settings" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-28260/images/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)
    
3.  In the "Security" section of the sidebar, click **Advanced Security**.
    
4.  To the right of "Code Security", click **Enable**.
    
5.  Under "Code Security", to the right of "CodeQL analysis", select **Set up** , then click **Default**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the "Code Security" section of "Advanced Security" settings. The "Default setup" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-92392/images/help/security/default-code-scanning-setup.png)
    
    You will then see a "CodeQL default configuration" dialog summarizing the code scanning configuration automatically created by default setup.
    
    Note
    
    If your repository contains _only_ compiled CodeQL-supported languages (for example, Java), you will be taken to the settings page to select the languages you want to add to your default setup configuration.
    
6.  Optionally, to customize your code scanning setup, click **Edit**.
    
    *   To add or remove a language from the analysis performed by default setup, select or deselect that language in the "Languages" section. If you would like to analyze a CodeQL-supported compiled language with default setup, select that language here.
    *   To specify the CodeQL query suite you would like to use, select your preferred query suite in the "Query suites" section.
7.  Review the settings for default setup on your repository, then click **Enable CodeQL**. This will trigger a workflow that tests the new, automatically generated configuration.
    
    Note
    
    If you are switching to default setup from advanced setup, you will see a warning informing you that default setup will override existing code scanning configurations. This warning means default setup will disable the existing workflow file and block any CodeQL analysis API uploads.
    
8.  Optionally, to view your default setup configuration after enablement, select , then click **View CodeQL configuration**.

## [Assigning labels to runners](#assigning-labels-to-runners)

Note

Code scanning sees assigned runners when default setup is enabled. If a runner is assigned to a repository that is already running default setup, you must disable and re-enable default setup to start using the runner. If you add a runner and want to start using it, you can change the configuration manually without needing to disable and re-enable default setup.

You can also assign self-hosted runners with the default `code-scanning` label, or you can optionally give them custom labels so that individual repositories can use different runners. For information about assigning labels to self-hosted runners, see [Using labels with self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-labels-with-self-hosted-runners).

Specifying custom labels for self-hosted runners is optional. Unless you have a specific use case, we recommend that you only assign runners with the default `code-scanning` label. For example, you may want to:

*   Assign more powerful self-hosted runners to critical repositories for faster code scanning analysis.
*   Run your code scanning analyses on a particular platform (for example, macOS).
*   Have granular control over the workload for your GitHub-hosted runners and self-hosted runners.

Once you've assigned custom labels to self-hosted runners, your repositories can use those runners for code scanning default setup. For more information, see [Configuring default setup for a repository](#configuring-default-setup-for-a-repository), earlier in this article.

You can also use security configurations to assign labels to self-hosted runners for code scanning. See [Creating a custom security configuration](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/meeting-your-specific-security-needs-with-custom-security-configurations/creating-a-custom-security-configuration#creating-a-custom-security-configuration).

### [Assigning larger runners](#assigning-larger-runners)

To assign a larger runner, name the runner `code-scanning`. This will automatically add the `code-scanning` label to the larger runner. An organization can only have one larger runner with the `code-scanning` label, and that runner will handle all code scanning jobs from repositories within your organization with access to the runner's group. See [Configuring larger runners for default setup](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/configuring-larger-runners-for-default-setup#provisioning-organization-level-larger-runners-for-default-setup).

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

After your configuration runs successfully at least once, you can start examining and resolving code scanning alerts. For more information on code scanning alerts, see [About code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-code-scanning-alerts) and [Assessing code scanning alerts for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/assessing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository).

After you've configured default setup for code scanning, you can read about evaluating how it's working for you and the next steps you can take to customize it. For more information, see [Evaluating default setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/evaluating-default-setup-for-code-scanning).

You can find detailed information about your code scanning configuration, including timestamps for each scan and the percentage of files scanned, on the tool status page. For more information, see [About the tool status page for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/about-the-tool-status-page).

When you configure default setup, you may encounter an error. For information on troubleshooting specific errors, see [Troubleshooting code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-code-scanning).

## https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning

# About code scanning - GitHub Docs

You can use code scanning to find security vulnerabilities and errors in the code for your project on GitHub.

## Who can use this feature?

Code scanning is available for the following repository types:

*   Public repositories on GitHub.com
*   Organization-owned repositories on GitHub Team with [GitHub Code Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) enabled

Code scanning is a feature that you use to analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any problems identified by the analysis are shown in your repository.

You can use code scanning to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code. Code scanning also prevents developers from introducing new problems. You can schedule scans for specific days and times, or trigger scans when a specific event occurs in the repository, such as a push.

If code scanning finds a potential vulnerability or error in your code, GitHub displays an alert in the repository. After you fix the code that triggered the alert, GitHub closes the alert. For more information, see [Resolving code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/resolving-code-scanning-alerts).

GitHub Copilot Autofix will suggest fixes for alerts from code scanning analysis in private repositories, allowing developers to prevent and reduce vulnerabilities with less effort. For more information, see [Responsible use of Copilot Autofix for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/responsible-use-autofix-code-scanning).

To monitor results from code scanning across your repositories or your organization, you can use webhooks and the code scanning API. For information about the webhooks for code scanning, see [Webhook events and payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#code_scanning_alert). For information about API endpoints, see [REST API endpoints for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning).

To get started with code scanning, see [Configuring default setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning).

## [About billing for code scanning](#about-billing-for-code-scanning)

Code scanning uses GitHub Actions, and each run of a code scanning workflow consumes minutes for GitHub Actions. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

To use code scanning on a private repository, you will also need a license for GitHub Code Security. For information about how you can try GitHub Enterprise with GitHub Advanced Security for free, see [Setting up a trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud) and [Setting up a trial of GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-advanced-security#setting-up-your-trial-of-github-advanced-security) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

## [About tools for code scanning](#about-tools-for-code-scanning)

You can configure code scanning to use the CodeQL product maintained by GitHub or a third-party code scanning tool.

### [About CodeQL analysis](#about-codeql-analysis)

CodeQL is the code analysis engine developed by GitHub to automate security checks. You can analyze your code using CodeQL and display the results as code scanning alerts. For more information about CodeQL, see [About code scanning with CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql).

### [About third-party code scanning tools](#about-third-party-code-scanning-tools)

Code scanning is interoperable with third-party code scanning tools that output Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) data. SARIF is an open standard. For more information, see [SARIF support for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning).

You can run third-party analysis tools within GitHub using actions or within an external CI system. For more information, see [Configuring advanced setup for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#configuring-code-scanning-using-third-party-actions) or [Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github).

## [About the tool status page](#about-the-tool-status-page)

The tool status page shows useful information about all of your code scanning tools. If code scanning is not working as you'd expect, the tool status page is a good starting point for debugging problems.

# Configuring network settings for GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs

You can connect to Copilot through an HTTP proxy and use custom certificates.

*   [JetBrains IDEs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/configuring-network-settings-for-github-copilot?tool=jetbrains)
*   [Visual Studio](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/configuring-network-settings-for-github-copilot?tool=visualstudio)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/configuring-network-settings-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode)

Note

GitHub Copilot is not currently available for use with Visual Studio for Mac.

## [Introduction](#introduction)

By default, GitHub Copilot connects to GitHub's server directly from your environment via a secure HTTPS connection. You don't necessarily need to configure any additional network settings to use Copilot.

Some networks use an HTTP proxy server to intercept Internet traffic before sending it to its intended location. Companies often use an HTTP proxy to detect suspicious traffic or restrict the content entering their networks. If you're working on a corporate network, you may need to configure Copilot to connect via an HTTP proxy.

## [Configuring proxy settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-proxy-settings-for-github-copilot)

GitHub Copilot supports basic HTTP proxy setups. If you need to authenticate to a proxy, GitHub Copilot supports basic authentication or authentication with Kerberos. If the proxy URL starts `https://`, the proxy is not currently supported.

You can configure an HTTP proxy for GitHub Copilot in your chosen editor. To view instructions for your editor, use the tabs at the top of this article.

If you don't configure a proxy directly in your editor, GitHub Copilot checks if a proxy URL is set in any of the following environment variables, listed from highest to lowest priority.

*   `HTTPS_PROXY`
*   `https_proxy`
*   `HTTP_PROXY`
*   `http_proxy`

Note

You can use any of these variables to store the URL of a standard HTTP proxy. In standard usage, the `http` and `https` portions of these variables refer to the type of request being made, not the URL of the proxy itself. GitHub Copilot does not follow this convention and uses the URL stored in the variable with the highest priority as the proxy for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

If you have configured a proxy but are still encountering connection errors, see [Troubleshooting network errors for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-network-errors-for-github-copilot#troubleshooting-proxy-errors).

### [Configuring a proxy in a JetBrains IDE](#configuring-a-proxy-in-a-jetbrains-ide)

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, click the **File** menu (Windows) or the name of the application in the menu bar (macOS), then click **Settings**.
    
2.  Under **Appearance & Behavior**, click **System Settings** and then click **HTTP Proxy**.
    
3.  Select **Manual proxy configuration**, and then select **HTTP**.
    
4.  In the "Host name" field, enter the hostname of your proxy server, and in the "Port number" field, enter the port number of your proxy server.
    
5.  Optionally, to configure Copilot to ignore certificate errors, in the left sidebar, click **Tools**, click **Server Certificates**, then select or deselect **Accept non-trusted certificates automatically**.
    
    Warning
    
    Ignoring certificate errors can cause security issues and is not recommended.

### [Basic authentication](#basic-authentication)

GitHub Copilot for JetBrains supports basic authentication. To authenticate, you can select **Proxy authentication** on the "Manual proxy configuration" page, then enter your credentials.

This stores your credentials as plaintext in your editor's settings. Alternatively, you may prefer to include your credentials in the proxy URL (for example: `http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.203.0.1:5187/`), and then set this URL as one of the supported environment variables listed in [Configuring proxy settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-proxy-settings-for-github-copilot).

### [Configuring a proxy in Visual Studio Code](#configuring-a-proxy-in-visual-studio-code)

1.  In the **File** menu, navigate to **Preferences** and click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of Visual Studio Code settings.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-99970/images/help/copilot/vsc-settings.png)
    
2.  In the left-side panel of the settings tab, click **Application** and then select **Proxy**.
    
3.  In the text box under "Proxy," type the address of your proxy server, for example `http://localhost:3128`.
    
4.  Optionally, to configure Copilot to ignore certificate errors, under "Proxy Strict SSL," select or deselect the checkbox.
    
    Warning
    
    Ignoring certificate errors can cause security issues and is not recommended.

### [Basic authentication](#basic-authentication-1)

GitHub Copilot for VS Code supports basic authentication. To authenticate, you can include your credentials in the proxy URL, for example: `http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.203.0.1:5187/`. You can store this URL in your VS Code settings or in one of the environment variables listed in [Configuring proxy settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-proxy-settings-for-github-copilot).

### [Configuring a proxy in Visual Studio](#configuring-a-proxy-in-visual-studio)

GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio reads the proxy settings from Windows. For information about configuring proxy settings on Windows, see the instructions under "To set up a proxy server connection manually" in [Use a proxy server in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-a-proxy-server-in-windows-03096c53-0554-4ffe-b6ab-8b1deee8dae1) in the Microsoft documentation.

### [Basic authentication](#basic-authentication-2)

GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio does not retrieve authentication credentials from the Windows settings. If you need to authenticate to a proxy, you can include your credentials in the proxy URL (for example: `http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.203.0.1:5187/`), then set this URL as one of the supported environment variables listed in [Configuring proxy settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-proxy-settings-for-github-copilot).

### [Authentication with Kerberos](#authentication-with-kerberos)

Kerberos is an authentication protocol that allows users and services to prove their identity to each other. When a user successfully authenticates, an authentication service grants the user a ticket that gives them access to a service for a period of time. Network administrators may prefer Kerberos to basic authentication because it is more secure and doesn't require sending unencrypted credentials.

GitHub Copilot supports authentication to a proxy with Kerberos. To use Kerberos, you must have the appropriate krb5 library for your operating system installed on your machine and an active ticket for the proxy service (either created manually with the `kinit` command or by another application). You can use the `klist` command to check if you have a ticket for the proxy service.

Kerberos uses a service principal name (SPN) to uniquely identify a service instance. By default, the SPN is derived from the proxy URL. For example, if the proxy URL is `http://proxy.example.com:3128`, the SPN is `HTTP/proxy.example.com`.

If the default SPN isn't correct for your proxy, you can override the SPN in VS Code and in JetBrains IDEs. You cannot currently override the default SPN in Visual Studio. However, you can use the environment variable `AGENT_KERBEROS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL` to override the SPN for Visual Studio and JetBrains IDEs.

#### [Overriding the default SPN in VS Code](#overriding-the-default-spn-in-vs-code)

1.  Open the VS Code Command Palette by pressing Shift+Command+P (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux).
    
2.  Type `settings`, then click **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
    
3.  In the JSON object, add the following top-level property, replacing `YOUR-SPN` with the correct SPN for your proxy service.
    
    JSON
    
    ```
    "http.proxyKerberosServicePrincipal": "YOUR-SPN",
    ```

#### [Overriding the default SPN in JetBrains IDEs](#overriding-the-default-spn-in-jetbrains-ides)

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, click the **File** menu (Windows) or the name of the application in the menu bar (macOS), then click **Settings**.
2.  In the left sidebar, click **Languages & Frameworks**, then click **GitHub Copilot**.
3.  In the "Advanced" section, in the "Override Kerberos Proxy Service Principal Name" field, type the SPN for your proxy service.

## [Allowing GitHub Copilot to use custom certificates](#allowing-github-copilot-to-use-custom-certificates)

Copilot can read custom SSL certificates installed on a user's machine. This allows a proxy server to be identified as the intended recipient of Copilot's secure connection, so network traffic can be inspected. Without a custom certificate, an HTTP proxy can be used to monitor, route, and terminate Copilot's connection, but not to inspect the contents of the traffic.

Copilot reads certificates from the operating system's trust store. It also reads extra certificates from the file specified by the standard Node.js environment variable `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/cli.html#node_extra_ca_certsfile).

Copilot can read certificates regardless of whether a proxy is configured directly on a user's machine. This allows Copilot to support setups such as transparent proxies or Zscaler.

### [Installing custom certificates](#installing-custom-certificates)

Generally, if you're using company equipment, your company's IT department should have already installed any required certificates on your machine. If you need to install a certificate, see the following instructions.

Warning

Installing a custom certificate is an instruction for your computer to trust the creator of the certificate, potentially allowing the creator to intercept all Internet traffic from your machine. You should be very careful to verify that you are installing the correct certificate.

*   For Windows, see [Installing the trusted root certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate) in the Microsoft documentation.
*   For macOS, see [Add certificates to a keychain using Keychain Access on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/keychain-access/kyca2431/mac) in the Keychain Access User Guide.
*   For Linux, see [Installing a root CA certificate in the trust store](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-trust-store) in the Ubuntu documentation. Similar instructions should apply to most Linux distributions.

If you have installed a certificate but Copilot isn't detecting it, see [Troubleshooting network errors for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-network-errors-for-github-copilot#troubleshooting-certificate-related-errors).

    ![Screenshot of the bottom panel in a JetBrains IDE. The GitHub Copilot status icon is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-3500/images/help/copilot/status-icon-jetbrains.png)
    
2.  If you are disabling GitHub Copilot, you will be asked whether you want to disable it globally, or for the language of the file you are currently editing. To disable globally, click **Disable Completions**. Alternatively, click the language-specific button to disable GitHub Copilot for the specified language.
    
    ![Screenshot of the menu to disable GitHub Copilot globally or for the current language in a JetBrains IDE.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-27124/images/help/copilot/disable-copilot-global-or-language-jetbrains.png)

## [Configuring advanced settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-advanced-settings-for-github-copilot)

You can manage advanced settings for GitHub Copilot in your JetBrains IDE, such as how your IDE displays code completions, and which languages you want to enable or disable for GitHub Copilot.

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, click the **File** menu (Windows), or the name of the application in the menu bar (macOS), then click **Settings**.
2.  Under **Languages & Frameworks**, click **GitHub Copilot**.
3.  Edit the settings according to your personal preferences.
    *   To adjust the behavior and appearance of code suggestions, and whether to automatically check for updates, select or deselect the corresponding checkboxes.
    *   If you have selected to receive automatic updates, you can choose whether to receive stable, but less frequent updates, or nightly updates, which may be less stable. Click the **Update channel** dropdown and select **Stable** for stable updates, or **Nightly** for nightly updates.

## [Configuring language settings for GitHub Copilot](#configuring-language-settings-for-github-copilot)

You can specify which languages you want to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for either in the IDE or by editing your `github-copilot.xml` file. If you make changes to language settings in your IDE, you can individually select and deselect the languages you want to activate or deactivate.

If you make changes to the language settings in your `github-copilot.xml` file, you can specify individual languages, or you can use a wildcard to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for all languages. You can also specify exceptions, which will override the wild card setting for the specified languages. For example, you can deactivate GitHub Copilot for all languages, except for Python and YAML. By default, when you install the GitHub Copilot extension, GitHub Copilot is activated for all languages.

### [Configuring language settings in the IDE](#configuring-language-settings-in-the-ide)

1.  In your JetBrains IDE, click the **File** menu (Windows), or the name of the application in the menu bar (macOS), then click **Settings**.
2.  Under **Languages & Frameworks**, click **GitHub Copilot**.
3.  Under "Languages," select or deselect the checkboxes for the languages you want to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for.
4.  Click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.
5.  Restart your JetBrains IDE for the changes to take effect.

### [Editing your `github-copilot.xml` file](#editing-your-github-copilotxml-file)

To configure language settings in the `github-copilot.xml` file, you must edit the `languageAllowList`. Every line you add to the `languageAllowList` must contain an entry key and a value. The entry key is the name of the language, or (`*`) for a wildcard. The value is either `true` or `false`. If the value is `true`, GitHub Copilot is activated for the specified language. If the value is `false`, GitHub Copilot is deactivated for the specified language.

The file is located in the following directory:

*   **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/<product><version>/options/github-copilot.xml`
*   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\JetBrains\<product><version>\options\github-copilot.xml`
*   **Linux:** `~/.config/JetBrains/<product><version>/options/github-copilot.xml`

For example, if you are using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1 on macOS, the file is located at `~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IdeaIC2021.1/options/github-copilot.xml`.

The `github-copilot.xml` file might not be generated until you make a change to your default language configuration in the IDE's settings. If you cannot locate the file, you should try modifying the default language settings in the IDE. For more information, see [Configuring language settings in the IDE](#configuring-language-settings-in-the-ide).

Alternatively, you can create the file manually and save it in the location for your operating system listed above. For more information, see [Example language configurations](#example-language-configurations).

1.  Open the `github-copilot.xml` file in a text editor.
    
2.  Between the `<map>` tags, add the line or lines for the languages you want to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for. For example, to deactivate GitHub Copilot for all languages:
    
    XML
    
    ```
    <entry key="*" value="false" />
    ```
    
3.  Save the changes to the `github-copilot.xml` file.
    
4.  Restart your JetBrains IDE for the changes to take effect.

### [Example language configurations](#example-language-configurations)

The default configuration of the `github-copilot.xml` file, which enables GitHub Copilot for all languages is as follows:

XML

```
<application>
  <component name="github-copilot">
    <languageAllowList>
      <map>
        <entry key="*" value="true" />
      </map>
    </languageAllowList>
  </component>
</application>
```

To deactivate GitHub Copilot for all languages, the wildcard (`*`) value is changed to `false`:

XML

```
<application>
  <component name="github-copilot">
    <languageAllowList>
      <map>
        <entry key="*" value="false" />
      </map>
    </languageAllowList>
  </component>
</application>
```

To specify languages individually, add an entry for each language you want to activate or deactivate GitHub Copilot for. Specific language settings will override the wildcard. For example, to activate GitHub Copilot for Python and YAML, and deactivate GitHub Copilot for all other languages, add the following entries:

XML

```
<application>
  <component name="github-copilot">
    <languageAllowList>
      <map>
        <entry key="*" value="false" />
        <entry key="Python" value="true" />
        <entry key="YAML" value="true" />
      </map>
    </languageAllowList>
  </component>
</application>
```

You can also add a configuration to make the `languageAllowList` readonly in the IDE's settings. This will prevent you from changing the language settings in the IDE. For example:

XML

```
<application>
  <component name="github-copilot">
    <option name="languageAllowListReadOnly" value="true" />
    <languageAllowList>
      <map>
        <entry key="*" value="true" />
      </map>
    </languageAllowList>
  </component>
</application>
```

# Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs

Create a file in a repository that gives Copilot additional context for the work it does in that repository.

*   [Visual Studio](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=visualstudio)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode)
*   [Web browser](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui)

Note

This feature is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

Repository custom instructions are currently supported for Copilot Chat in Visual Studio, VS Code and on the GitHub website. They are also supported for Copilot coding agent.

This version of this article is for using repository custom instructions on the GitHub website. Click the tabs above for information on using custom instructions in other environments.

For an overview of the methods you can use to customize GitHub Copilot Chat responses, see [About customizing GitHub Copilot Chat responses](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/about-customizing-github-copilot-chat-responses?tool=webui). For information on customizing Copilot coding agent see [Customizing the development environment for Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/customizing-the-development-environment-for-copilot-coding-agent).

## [About repository custom instructions for Copilot](#about-repository-custom-instructions-for-copilot)

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create a file in your repository that automatically adds this information for you. The additional information is not displayed in the chat, but is available to Copilot to allow it to generate higher quality responses.

The custom instructions file is also used by Copilot when you assign it to an issue or ask it to create a pull request. Instructions included in this file can help Copilot to work on files in a way that matches your team's working practices and conforms to coding standards for your project. See [About assigning tasks to Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/about-assigning-tasks-to-copilot).

### [Example](#example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be added to all chat questions.

```
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

Note

Repository custom instructions are currently supported for Copilot Chat in Visual Studio, VS Code and on the GitHub website.

This version of this article is for using repository custom instructions in VS Code. Click the tabs above for instructions on using custom instructions in other environments.

For an overview of the methods you can use to customize GitHub Copilot Chat responses, see [About customizing GitHub Copilot Chat responses](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/about-customizing-github-copilot-chat-responses?tool=vscode).

## [About repository custom instructions and prompt files for GitHub Copilot Chat](#about-repository-custom-instructions-and-prompt-files-for-github-copilot-chat)

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create files in your repository that automatically add this information for you.

There are two types of files you can use to provide context and instructions to GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code:

*   **Repository custom instructions** allow you to specify repository-wide instructions and preferences, in a single file, that apply to any conversation held in the context of the repository.
*   **Prompt files** (public preview) allow you to save common prompt instructions and relevant context in Markdown files (`*.prompt.md`) that you can then reuse in your chat prompts. Prompt files are only available in VS Code.

While custom instructions help to add codebase-wide context to each AI workflow, prompt files let you add instructions to a specific chat interaction.

### [Repository custom instructions example](#repository-custom-instructions-example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be added to all chat questions.

```
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

### [Prompt file examples](#prompt-file-examples)

The following examples demonstrate how to use prompt files.

*   `New React form.prompt.md` - contains instructions for a reusable task to generate a form using React.
    
    ```
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component.
    
    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.
    
    Requirements for the form:
    - Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    - Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
      - Always define TypeScript types for your form data
      - Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
      - Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
    - Use `yup` for validation:
      - Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
      - Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
      - Customize UX-friendly validation rules
    ```
    
*   `API security review.prompt.md` - contains reusable information about security practices for REST APIs, which can be used to do security reviews of REST APIs.
    
    ```
    Secure REST API review:
    - Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
    - Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling
    - Implement logging and monitoring for security events
    …
    ```

```

## [Prerequisites for repository custom instructions](#prerequisites-for-repository-custom-instructions)

*   A custom instructions file (see the instructions below).

*   Your personal choice of whether to use custom instructions must be set to enabled. This is enabled by default. See [Enabling or disabling repository custom instructions](#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions) later in this article.
*   During the public preview, if you're using a Copilot Business plan, the organization that provides your plan must have the **Opt in to preview features** setting enabled. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization).

*   The **Use Instruction Files** option must be enabled in your settings. This is enabled by default. See [Enabling or disabling repository custom instructions](#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions) later in this article.

*   The **Enable custom instructions** option must be enabled in your settings. This is disabled by default. See [Enabling or disabling repository custom instructions](#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions) later in this article.

## [Creating a repository custom instructions file](#creating-a-repository-custom-instructions-file)

1.  In the root of your repository, create a file named `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
    
    Create the `.github` directory if it does not already exist.
    
2.  Add natural language instructions to the file, in Markdown format.
    
    Whitespace between instructions is ignored, so the instructions can be written as a single paragraph, each on a new line, or separated by blank lines for legibility.

To see your instructions in action, go to [https://github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot), attach the repository containing the instructions file, and start a conversation.

Did you successfully add a custom instructions file to your repository?

[Yes](https://docs.github.io/success-test/yes.html) [No](https://docs.github.io/success-test/no.html)

## [Writing effective repository custom instructions](#writing-effective-repository-custom-instructions)

The instructions you add to the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file should be short, self-contained statements that add context or relevant information to supplement users' chat questions.

You should also consider the size and complexity of your repository. The following types of instructions may work for a small repository with only a few contributors, but for a large and diverse repository, they may cause problems with other areas of Copilot:

*   Requests to refer to external resources when formulating a response
*   Instructions to answer in a particular style
*   Requests to always respond with a certain level of detail

For example, the following instructions may not have the intended results:

```
Always conform to the coding styles defined in styleguide.md in repo my-org/my-repo when generating code.

Use @terminal when answering questions about Git.

Answer all questions in the style of a friendly colleague, using informal language.

Answer all questions in less than 1000 characters, and words of no more than 12 characters.
```

## [Repository custom instructions in use](#repository-custom-instructions-in-use)

The instructions in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file are available for use by Copilot Chat as soon as you save the file. The complete set of instructions will be automatically added to chat prompts that relate to the repository containing the instructions file.

In Copilot Chat's immersive view ([github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot)), you can start a conversation that uses repository custom instructions by adding, as an attachment, the repository that contains the instructions file.

Whenever repository custom instructions are used by Copilot Chat, the instructions file is added as a reference for the response that's generated. To find out whether repository custom instructions were used, expand the list of references at the top of a chat response in the Chat panel and check whether the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is listed.

![Screenshot of an expanded References list, showing the 'copilot-instructions.md' file highlighted with a dark orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-42321/images/help/copilot/custom-instructions-ref-in-github.png)

You can click the reference to open the file.

Note

*   It is possible for multiple types of custom instructions to apply to a conversation. Personal instructions take the highest priority, followed by repository instructions, with organization instructions prioritized last. However, all sets of relevant instructions are still combined and provided to Copilot Chat.
*   Whenever possible, you should avoid providing conflicting sets of instructions. If you are concerned about response quality, you can also choose to temporarily disable repository instructions. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions).

The instructions in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file are available for use by Copilot Chat as soon as you save the file. The complete set of instructions will be automatically attached to requests that you submit in either the Copilot Chat view, or in inline chat.

Custom instructions are not visible in the Chat view or inline chat, but you can verify that they are being used by Copilot by looking at the References list of a response in the Chat view. If custom instructions were added to the prompt that was sent to the model, the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is listed as a reference. You can click the reference to open the file.

## [Enabling or disabling repository custom instructions](#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions)

You can choose whether or not to have custom instructions added to your chat questions.

1.  Click the button at the top of the Chat panel, or the top right of the immersive page.
    
2.  Click **Disable custom instructions** or **Enable custom instructions**.
    
    Note
    
    In immersive mode, you will only see these options if you have attached a repository that contains a custom instructions file.

Your choice persists until you change it.

1.  Open the Setting editor by using the keyboard shortcut Command+, (Mac) / Ctrl+, (Linux/Windows).
2.  Type `instruction file` in the search box.
3.  Select or clear the checkbox under **Code Generation: Use Instruction Files**.

1.  In the Visual Studio menu bar, under **Tools**, click **Options**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio menu bar. The "Tools" menu is expanded, and the "Options" item is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-37169/images/help/copilot/vs-toolbar-options.png)
    
2.  In the "Options" dialog, type `custom instructions` in the search box, then click **Copilot**.
    
3.  Select or clear the checkbox for **(Preview) Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/copilot-instructions.md files and added to requests**.

## [Enabling and using prompt files](#enabling-and-using-prompt-files)

Note

Prompt files are public preview and subject to change.

Prompt files let you build and share reusable prompt instructions with additional context. A prompt file is a Markdown file, stored in your workspace, that mimics the existing format of writing prompts in Copilot Chat (for example, `Rewrite #file:x.ts`). You can have multiple prompt files in your workspace, each of which defines a prompt for a different purpose.

### [Enabling prompt files](#enabling-prompt-files)

To enable prompt files, configure the workspace settings.

1.  Open the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) / Command+Shift+P (Mac).
2.  Type "Open Workspace Settings (JSON)" and select the option that's displayed.
3.  In the `settings.json` file, add `"chat.promptFiles": true` to enable the `.github/prompts` folder as the location for prompt files. This folder will be created if it does not already exist.

### [Creating prompt files](#creating-prompt-files)

1.  Open the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) / Command+Shift+P (Mac).
    
2.  Type "prompt" and select **Chat: Create Prompt**.
    
3.  Enter a name for the prompt file, excluding the `.prompt.md` file name extension. The name can contain alphanumeric characters and spaces and should describe the purpose of the prompt information the file will contain.
    
4.  Write the prompt instructions, using Markdown formatting.
    
    You can reference other files in the workspace by using Markdown links—for example, `[index](../../web/index.ts)`—or by using the `#file:../../web/index.ts` syntax. Paths are relative to the prompt file. Referencing other files allows you to provide additional context, such as API specifications or product documentation.

### [Using prompt files](#using-prompt-files)

1.  At the bottom of the Copilot Chat view, click the **Attach context** icon ().
    
2.  In the dropdown menu, click **Prompt...** and choose the prompt file you want to use.
    
3.  Optionally, attach additional files, including prompt files, to provide more context.
    
4.  Optionally, type additional information in the chat prompt box.
    
    Whether you need to do this or not depends on the contents of the prompt you are using.
    
5.  Submit the chat prompt.

For more information about prompt files, see [Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_reusable-prompt-files-experimental) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

## https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization

# Applying the GitHub-recommended security configuration in your organization - GitHub Docs

Secure your code with the security enablement settings created, managed, and recommended by GitHub.

## Who can use this feature?

Organization owners, security managers, and organization members with the **admin** role

## [About the GitHub-recommended security configuration](#about-the-github-recommended-security-configuration)

The GitHub-recommended security configuration is a collection of enablement settings for GitHub's security features that is created and maintained by subject matter experts at GitHub. The GitHub-recommended security configuration is designed to successfully reduce the security risks for low- and high-impact repositories. We recommend you apply this configuration to all the repositories in your organization.

Note

The GitHub-recommended security configuration includes GitHub Code Security and GitHub Secret Protection features. Applying the configuration to private and internal repositories in your organization will incur usage costs or require licenses.

## [Applying the GitHub-recommended security configuration to all repositories in your organization](#applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-to-all-repositories-in-your-organization)

1.  In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.
    
2.  Under your organization name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the tabs in an organization's profile. The "Settings" tab is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49309/images/help/discussions/org-settings-global-nav-update.png)
    
3.  In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select the **Advanced Security** dropdown menu, then click **Configurations**.
    
4.  In the "GitHub recommended" row of the configurations table for your organization, select the **Apply to** dropdown menu, then click **All repositories** or **All repositories without configurations**.
    
    Note
    
    The default security configuration for an organization is only automatically applied to new repositories created in your organization. If a repository is transferred into your organization, you will still need to apply an appropriate security configuration to the repository manually.
    
5.  Review the detailed information about how your changes will affect GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security license consumption. To apply the security configuration, click **Apply**.

The security configuration is applied to both active and archived repositories because some security features run on archived repositories, for example, secret scanning. In addition, if a repository is later unarchived you can be confident that it is protected by the chosen security configuration.

## [Applying the GitHub-recommended security configuration to specific repositories in your organization](#applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-to-specific-repositories-in-your-organization)

1.  In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.
    
2.  Under your organization name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the tabs in an organization's profile. The "Settings" tab is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49309/images/help/discussions/org-settings-global-nav-update.png)
    
3.  In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select the **Advanced Security** dropdown menu, then click **Configurations**.
    
4.  Optionally, in the "Apply configurations" section, filter the view to find the repositories you would like to apply the GitHub-recommended security configuration to. To learn how to filter the repository table, see [Filtering repositories in your organization using the repository table](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/managing-the-security-of-your-organization/filtering-repositories-in-your-organization-using-the-repository-table).
    
5.  In the repository table, select repositories with one of three methods:
    
    *   Select each repository you would like to apply the security configuration to.
    *   To select all repositories displayed on the current page of the repository table, select the checkbox associated with "NUMBER repositories".
    *   After selecting the current page of repositories, "25 of NUMBER selected", to select _all_ repositories in your organization that match any filters you have applied, click **Select all**.
6.  Select the **Apply configuration** dropdown menu, then click **GitHub recommended**.
    
    Note
    
    The default security configuration for an organization is only automatically applied to new repositories created in your organization. If a repository is transferred into your organization, you will still need to apply an appropriate security configuration to the repository manually.
    
7.  Review the detailed information about how your changes will affect GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security license consumption. To apply the security configuration, click **Apply**.

The security configuration is applied to both active and archived repositories because some security features run on archived repositories, for example, secret scanning. In addition, if a repository is later unarchived you can be confident that it is protected by the chosen security configuration.

## [Enforcing the GitHub-recommended security configuration](#enforcing-the-github-recommended-security-configuration)

1.  In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.
    
2.  Under your organization name, click **Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the tabs in an organization's profile. The "Settings" tab is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49309/images/help/discussions/org-settings-global-nav-update.png)
    
3.  In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select the **Advanced Security** dropdown menu, then click **Configurations**.
    
4.  In the "Security configurations" section, select "GitHub recommended".
    
5.  In the "Policy" section, next to "Enforce configuration", select **Enforce** from the dropdown menu.

Note

If a user in your organization attempts to change the enablement status of a feature in an enforced configuration using the REST API, the API call will appear to succeed, but no enablement statuses will change.

Some situations can break the enforcement of security configurations for a repository. For example, the enablement of code scanning will not apply to a repository if:

*   GitHub Actions is initially enabled on the repository, but is then disabled in the repository.
*   GitHub Actions required by code scanning configurations are not available in the repository.
*   The definition for which languages should not be analyzed using code scanning default setup is changed.

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

After you apply the GitHub-recommended security configuration, you can customize your organization-level security settings with global settings. See [Configuring global security settings for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/configuring-global-security-settings-for-your-organization).

You may encounter an error when you attempt to apply a security configuration. For more information, see [Finding and fixing configuration attachment failures](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/managing-the-security-of-your-organization/finding-repositories-with-attachment-failures) and [Troubleshooting security configurations](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/troubleshooting-security-configurations).

## [Overview](#overview)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications share context with large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools, enabling them to work together more effectively.

You can use MCP to extend the capabilities of Copilot Chat by integrating it with a wide range of existing tools and services. For example, the GitHub MCP server allows you to use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code to perform tasks on GitHub. You can also use MCP to create new tools and services that work with Copilot Chat, allowing you to customize and enhance your experience.

For more information on MCP, see [the official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

For information on some of the other currently available MCP servers, see [the MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

*   **Access to Copilot**. For information about how to get access to Copilot, see [What is GitHub Copilot?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot).
*   **Visual Studio Code version 1.99 or later**. For information on installing Visual Studio Code, see the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## [Configuring MCP servers in Visual Studio Code](#configuring-mcp-servers-in-visual-studio-code)

To configure MCP servers in Visual Studio Code, you need to set up a configuration script that specifies the details of the MCP servers you want to use. You can configure MCP servers for either:

*   **A specific repository**. This enables you to share MCP servers with anyone who opens the project in Visual Studio Code. To do this, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in the root of your repository.
    
*   **Your personal instance of Visual Studio Code**. You will be the only person who has access to configured MCP servers. To do this, add the configuration to your `settings.json` file in Visual Studio Code. MCP servers configured this way will be available in all workspaces.
    
    Note
    
    We recommend you use only one location per server. Adding the same server to both locations may cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

The steps below show how to configure the Fetch MCP server in your `.vscode/mcp.json` file. The Fetch MCP server is a simple MCP server that provides web content fetching capabilities. For more information on the Fetch MCP server, see [the Fetch directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) in the MCP Server repository.

You can use the same steps to configure MCP servers in your personal Visual Studio Code settings. Details on how to configure other MCP servers are available in the [MCP servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main).

For information on configuring the GitHub MCP server, see [Using the GitHub MCP Server](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/using-model-context-protocol/using-the-github-mcp-server).

1.  Add the following configuration to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file:
    
    JSON
    
    ```
    {
    "inputs": [
      // The "inputs" section defines the inputs required for the MCP server configuration.
      {
        "type": "promptString"
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      // The "servers" section defines the MCP servers you want to use.
      "fetch": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
      }
     }
    }
    ```
    
2.  Save the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.
    
3.  A "Start" button will appear in your `.vscode/mcp.json` file, at the top of the list of servers. Click the "Start" button to start the MCP servers. This will trigger the input dialog and discover the server tools, which are then stored for later sessions.
    
    ![Screenshot of MCP server configuration in Visual Studio Code. The "Start" button is outlined in dark orange. ](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-51859/images/help/copilot/mcp-start-server-button.png)
    
4.  Open Copilot Chat by clicking the icon in the title bar of Visual Studio Code.
    
5.  In the Copilot Chat box, select **Agent** from the popup menu.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Copilot Chat box in Visual Studio Code. The "Agent" option is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-38150/images/help/copilot/copilot-chat-agent-option.png)
    
6.  To view your list of available MCP servers, click the tools icon in the top left corner of the chat box. This will open the MCP server list, where you can see all the MCP servers and associated tools that are currently available in your Visual Studio Code instance.
    
    *   Optionally, you can define toolsets, groups of related tools that you can reference in chat. Toolsets make it easier to group related MCP tools together and quickly enable or disable them. For information on how to define and use a toolset, see the [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_define-tool-sets).

For more information on configuring MCP servers in Visual Studio Code, see [Use MCP servers in Visual Studio Code (Preview)](https://aka.ms/vscode-add-mcp) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

## [Using MCP servers in Copilot Chat](#using-mcp-servers-in-copilot-chat)

Once you have configured your MCP servers, you can use them in Copilot Chat to access a wide range of tools and services. In the example below, we will use the Fetch MCP server to fetch details about a web page.

1.  Open Copilot Chat by clicking the icon in the title bar of Visual Studio Code.
    
2.  In the Copilot Chat box, select **Agent** from the popup menu.
    
3.  In the file with the MCP configuration, check that the MCP server is running. If it is not running, click the "Start" button to start the MCP server.
    
    ![Screenshot of the MCP server configuration in Visual Studio Code. The "Running" status is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-68101/images/help/copilot/vsc-mcp-server-running.png)
    
4.  Ask Copilot Chat to fetch the details of a URL. For example:
    
    `Fetch https://github.com/github/docs.`
    
5.  If Copilot asks you to confirm that you want to proceed, click **Continue**.
    
6.  Copilot will fetch the details of the URL and display them in the chat box.

Optionally, you can use MCP prompts and resources in VS Code.

*   MCP servers can define preconfigured prompts for interacting with their tools. You can access these prompts in chat with slash commands, using the format `/mcp.servername.promptname`.
*   MCP servers provide resources, which are any kind of data that the server wants to make available. For example, the GitHub MCP server provides repository content as a resource. To add resources from an MCP server to your chat context, click **Add Context...** in the chat box, then click **MCP Resources**.

For more information on using MCP servers in Visual Studio Code, see [Use MCP servers in Visual Studio Code (Preview)](https://aka.ms/vscode-add-mcp) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

## [Using existing MCP configurations](#using-existing-mcp-configurations)

If you already have an MCP configuration in Claude Desktop, you can use that configuration in Visual Studio Code to access the same MCP servers. To do this, add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file in Visual Studio Code:

JSON

```
"chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true
```

Visual Studio Code will automatically find your existing configuration and use it in your Visual Studio Code instance.

## [About customizing GitHub Copilot Chat responses](#about-customizing-github-copilot-chat-responses)

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to your personal preferences, the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create custom instructions that automatically add this information for you. The additional information is not displayed in the chat, but is available to Copilot to allow it to generate higher quality responses.

### [Types of custom instructions](#types-of-custom-instructions)

*   **Personal custom instructions** apply to all conversations you have with Copilot Chat across the GitHub website. They allow you to specify your individual preferences, such as preferred language or response style, ensuring that the responses are tailored to your personal needs.
*   **Repository custom instructions** apply to conversations within the context of a specific repository. They are useful for defining project-specific coding standards, frameworks, or tools. For example, you can specify that a repository uses TypeScript and a particular library, ensuring consistent responses for all contributors.
*   **Organization custom instructions (public preview)** apply to conversations within the context of an organization on the GitHub website. They are ideal for enforcing organization-wide preferences, such as a common language or security guidelines. Organization custom instructions can only be set by organization owners for organizations with a Copilot Enterprise subscription.

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create files in your repository that automatically add this information for you.

There are two types of files you can use to provide context and instructions to GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code:

*   **Repository custom instructions** allow you to specify repository-wide instructions and preferences, in a single file, that apply to any conversation held in the context of the repository.
*   **Prompt files** (public preview) allow you to save common prompt instructions and relevant context in Markdown files (`*.prompt.md`) that you can then reuse in your chat prompts. Prompt files are only available in VS Code.

While custom instructions help to add codebase-wide context to each AI workflow, prompt files let you add instructions to a specific chat interaction.

GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat questions, you can create a custom instructions file in your repository that automatically adds this information for you. The additional information is not displayed in the chat, but is available to Copilot to allow it to generate higher quality responses.

## [Using custom instructions](#using-custom-instructions)

Custom instructions consist of natural language instructions and are most effective when they are short, self-contained statements. Consider the scope over which you want the instruction to apply when choosing whether to add an instruction on the personal, repository, or (if available) organization level.

Note

*   It is possible for multiple types of custom instructions to apply to a conversation. Personal instructions take the highest priority, followed by repository instructions, with organization instructions prioritized last. However, all sets of relevant instructions are still combined and provided to Copilot Chat.
*   Whenever possible, you should avoid providing conflicting sets of instructions. If you are concerned about response quality, you can also choose to temporarily disable repository instructions. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions).

Here are some common use cases and examples for each type of custom instructions:

*   **Personal custom instructions:**
    *   Preferred individual language: `Always respond in Portuguese.`
    *   Individual response preferences: `Explain a single concept per line. Be clear and concise.`
*   **Repository custom instructions:**
    *   Coding standards: `Use early returns whenever possible.`
    *   Frameworks: `Use Vue with the PrimeVue library.` or `Use Typescript rather than Javascript.`
    *   Code style preferences: `Use camel case for variable names.`
*   **Organization custom instructions:**
    *   Describe how to answer certain questions: `For questions related to security, use the Security Docs Knowledge Base or advise people to consult with #security on Slack.`
    *   Preferred language for a company which exclusively speaks a single language: `Always respond in Portuguese.`
    *   Organization-wide preferences: `Do not generate code blocks in responses.`

## [About repository custom instructions](#about-repository-custom-instructions)

Repository custom instructions consist of a single file, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, that you create in a repository. The instructions you add to the file should be short, self-contained statements that add context or relevant information to supplement chat questions.

Common use cases include:

*   **Test generation.** Create instructions for test generation, such as specifying the use of a certain test framework.
*   **Code review.** Specify instructions for reviewing code, such as telling a reviewer to look for a specific error in the code.
*   **Commit message generation.** Write instructions for generating commit messages, such as format or the type of information to include.

### [Example](#example)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be added to all chat questions.

```
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

## [About prompt files](#about-prompt-files)

Note

Prompt files are public preview and subject to change.

Prompt files let you build and share reusable prompt instructions with additional context. A prompt file is a Markdown file, stored in your workspace, that mimics the existing format of writing prompts in Copilot Chat (for example, `Rewrite #file:x.ts`). This allows blending natural language instructions, additional context, and even linking to other prompt files as dependencies.

Common use cases include:

*   **Code generation**. Create reusable prompts for components, tests, or migrations (for example, React forms, or API mocks).
*   **Domain expertise**. Share specialized knowledge through prompts, such as security practices, or compliance checks.
*   **Team collaboration**. Document patterns and guidelines with references to specs and documentation.
*   **Onboarding**. Create step-by-step guides for complex processes or project-specific patterns.

You can have multiple prompt files in your workspace, each of which defines a prompt for a different purpose.

### [Examples](#examples)

The following examples demonstrate how to use prompt files.

*   `New React form.prompt.md` - contains instructions for a reusable task to generate a form using React.
    
    ```
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component.
    
    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.
    
    Requirements for the form:
    - Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    - Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
      - Always define TypeScript types for your form data
      - Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
      - Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
    - Use `yup` for validation:
      - Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
      - Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
      - Customize UX-friendly validation rules
    ```
    
*   `API security review.prompt.md` - contains reusable information about security practices for REST APIs, which can be used to do security reviews of REST APIs.
    
    ```
    Secure REST API review:
    - Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
    - Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling
    - Implement logging and monitoring for security events
    …
    ```

## [About repository custom instructions](#about-repository-custom-instructions-1)

Repository custom instructions consist of a single file, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, that you create in a repository. The instructions you add to the file should be short, self-contained statements that add context or relevant information to supplement chat questions.

Common use cases include:

*   **Test generation.** Create instructions for test generation, such as specifying the use of a certain test framework.
*   **Code review.** Specify instructions for reviewing code, such as telling a reviewer to look for a specific error in the code.
*   **Commit message generation.** Write instructions for generating commit messages, such as format or the type of information to include.

### [Example](#example-1)

This example of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains three instructions that will be added to all chat questions.

```

# Quickstart for GitHub Copilot Extensions using agents - GitHub Docs

Build and try out GitHub's Blackbeard extension to learn about the development process for GitHub Copilot Extensions.

*   [Bash](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/quickstart-for-github-copilot-extensions-using-agents?tool=bash)
*   [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/quickstart-for-github-copilot-extensions-using-agents?tool=codespaces)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/quickstart-for-github-copilot-extensions-using-agents?tool=vscode)

The [Blackbeard extension](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension) is a GitHub Copilot Extension that comprises a GitHub App and a Copilot agent. The agent responds to chat requests in the style of a pirate, using Copilot's large language model (LLM) API and special system prompts. See [About Copilot agents](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/building-a-copilot-agent-for-your-copilot-extension/about-copilot-agents).

This guide uses a simple agent implementation, but the process is similar for skillsets. For information about the difference between agents and skillsets, see [About building Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#about-skillsets-and-agents).

This quickstart is designed to help you build and chat with the Blackbeard extension as quickly as possible, so you can develop and test your extension without deploying infrastructure. For production, you'll need to host the application for your agent or skillset's endpoints on a publicly accessible server. To instead learn how to create a new GitHub Copilot Extension, see [Setting up Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/setting-up-copilot-extensions).

## [2\. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent locally](#2-clone-and-host-the-blackbeard-agent-locally)

Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent locally for a significantly faster build process.

1.  Using the Terminal built into VS Code, clone the [`copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension`](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension) repository.
2.  In the same Terminal, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies, then run `npm start` to start the Blackbeard agent on port 3000.
3.  In the "Ports" tab of the VS Code panel, click **Forward a port** or **Add port**, then add port 3000.
4.  Right-click the port and set the visibility to "Public," then copy the local address.

## [3\. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension](#3-integrate-and-test-the-blackbeard-extension)

After you set up your GitHub App and Blackbeard agent, you can integrate the agent with your app and test the Blackbeard extension. You need to make the following changes to your GitHub App settings:

*   In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the local address for your agent.
*   In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
*   In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing `@YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME` in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.

For more detailed instructions, see [Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/creating-a-copilot-extension/configuring-your-github-app-for-your-copilot-agent#configuring-your-github-app).

## [2\. Clone and host the Blackbeard agent in a codespace](#2-clone-and-host-the-blackbeard-agent-in-a-codespace)

Rather than deploying the Blackbeard agent as a web app, you can host your agent in a codespace for a significantly faster build process.

1.  Navigate to the [`copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension`](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/blackbeard-extension) repository. Select the **Code** dropdown menu, then click **Create codespace on main**.

## [3\. Expose your local server](#3-expose-your-local-server)

To make the Blackbeard agent accessible to the Copilot platform and GitHub, you need to expose your local server so it's reachable by HTTP requests. You can use any port forwarding or tunneling service to achieve this. For the following steps, we'll use ngrok.

1.  Navigate to [ngrok's download page](https://ngrok.com/downloads/), then install the appropriate version of ngrok for your operating system.
    
2.  Navigate to the [ngrok setup and installation page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/), then log in or sign up for an ngrok account.
    
3.  To expose your local server, in a new window of your command line application, run the following command:
    
    Shell
    
    ```
    ngrok http http://localhost:3000
    ```
    
4.  In your command line application, next to "Forwarding," copy the URL that ngrok assigned to your server.

## [4\. Integrate and test the Blackbeard extension](#4-integrate-and-test-the-blackbeard-extension)

To integrate your GitHub App with the Blackbeard agent, you need to make the following changes to your app settings:

*   In the "General" settings, in the "Callback URL" field, paste the URL for your exposed server.
*   In the "Permissions & events" settings, grant read-only permissions to Copilot Chat.
*   In the "Copilot" settings, set your app type to "Agent," then fill out the remaining fields.

After you update your GitHub App settings, you can start chatting with your extension by typing `@YOUR-EXTENSION-NAME` in the Copilot Chat window, then sending a prompt as normal.

For more detailed instructions, see [Configuring your GitHub App for your Copilot extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/creating-a-copilot-extension/configuring-your-github-app-for-your-copilot-agent#configuring-your-github-app).

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

Now that you have a working GitHub Copilot Extension, you can try building on the Blackbeard agent to experiment with agent development.

To learn about more complex agent implementations, you can also review the following example agents and software development kit (SDK), all of which are available in the [`copilot-extensions`](https://github.com/copilot-extensions) organization:

*   [GitHub Models](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/github-models-extension): A more complex agent that lets you ask about and interact with various LLMs listed on the GitHub Marketplace through Copilot Chat. The GitHub Models agent makes use of function calling.
*   [Function Calling](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/function-calling-extension): An example agent written in Go that demonstrates function calling and confirmation dialogs.
*   [RAG Extension](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/rag-extension): An example agent written in Go that demonstrates a simple implementation of retrieval augmented generation.
*   [Preview SDK](https://github.com/copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js/tree/main): An SDK that streamlines the development of Copilot Extensions by handling request verification, payload parsing, and response formatting automatically. This SDK allows extension builders to focus more on creating core functionality and less on boilerplate code.

# Forwarding ports in your codespace - GitHub Docs

You can forward ports in your codespace to test and debug your application. You can also manage the port protocol and share the port within your organization or publicly.

*   [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace?tool=cli)
*   [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace?tool=vscode)
*   [Web browser](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace?tool=webui)

## [About forwarded ports](#about-forwarded-ports)

Port forwarding gives you access to TCP ports running within your codespace. For example, if you're running a web application on a particular port in your codespace, you can forward that port. This allows you to access the application from the browser on your local machine for testing and debugging.

When an application running inside a codespace prints output to the terminal that contains a localhost URL, such as `http://localhost:PORT` or `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, the port is automatically forwarded. If you're using GitHub Codespaces in the browser or in Visual Studio Code, the URL string in the terminal is converted into a link that you can click to view the web page on your local machine. By default, GitHub Codespaces forwards ports using HTTP.

You can edit the dev container configuration for the repository to automatically forward one or more ports. You can also forward a port manually, label forwarded ports, share forwarded ports with members of your organization, share forwarded ports publicly, and add forwarded ports to the codespace configuration.

## [Forwarding a port](#forwarding-a-port)

You can manually forward a port that wasn't forwarded automatically.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Under the list of ports, click **Add port**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the "Add port" button for a codespace.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-3926/images/help/codespaces/add-port-button.png)
    
4.  Type the port number or address, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the number 3000 being entered into the port number field for a new forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-9504/images/help/codespaces/port-number-text-box.png)

## [Using HTTPS forwarding](#using-https-forwarding)

By default, GitHub Codespaces forwards ports using HTTP but you can update any port to use HTTPS, as needed. If you update a port with public visibility to use HTTPS, the port's visibility will automatically change to private.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port you want to update, then hover over **Change Port Protocol**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Change Port Protocol" option selected and "HTTPS" selected in the submenu.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-57179/images/help/codespaces/update-port-protocol.png)
    
4.  Select the protocol needed for this port. The protocol that you select will be remembered for this port for the lifetime of the codespace.

## [Sharing a port](#sharing-a-port)

Note

You can only make a port private to an organization if your organization uses GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

If you want to share a forwarded port with others, you can either make the port private to your organization or make the port public. After you make a port private to your organization, anyone in the organization with the port's URL can view the running application. After you make a port public, anyone who knows the URL and port number can view the running application without needing to authenticate.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port that you want to share, click the **Port Visibility**, then click **Private to Organization** or **Public**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Port Visibility" option selected and "Private" selected in the submenu.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59966/images/help/codespaces/make-public-option.png)
    
4.  To the right of the local address for the port, click the copy icon.
    
    ![Screenshot of the "Ports" panel. The copy icon, which copies a forwarded port's URL, is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19922/images/help/codespaces/copy-icon-port-url.png)
    
5.  Send the copied URL to the person you want to share the port with.

## [Using command-line tools and REST clients to access ports](#using-command-line-tools-and-rest-clients-to-access-ports)

When you forward a port, your application becomes available at the URL `https://CODESPACENAME-PORT.app.github.dev`. For example, `https://monalisa-hot-potato-vrpqrxxrx7x2rxx-4000.app.github.dev`. If you forward a private port from the VS Code desktop application, your application will also be available at a localhost port such as `127.0.0.1:4000`.

To access your application using a REST client, such as Postman, or a command-line tool like curl, you don't need to authenticate if you're using a localhost port, or if you're accessing a public port at the remote domain. However, to connect to a private port at the remote domain, you must authenticate by using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token in your request.

Note

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically created when you start a codespace and remains the same for the duration of the codespace session. If you stop and then restart a codespace a new `GITHUB_TOKEN` is generated.

### [Finding the address to connect to](#finding-the-address-to-connect-to)

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab. This lists all of the ports you have forwarded.
    
3.  Right-click the port you want to connect to and click **Copy Local Address**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port with the "Copy Local Address" option highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-60900/images/help/codespaces/copy-local-address.png)
    
4.  Paste the copied address somewhere for later use.

### [Finding the GITHUB\_TOKEN](#finding-the-github_token)

1.  In the terminal in your codespace, enter `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    
    The token is a string beginning `ghu_`.
    
2.  Copy the token.
    
    Important
    
    Don't share this access token with anyone.

### [Using curl to access a forwarded port](#using-curl-to-access-a-forwarded-port)

In a terminal on your local computer, enter:

```
curl ADDRESS -H "X-Github-Token: TOKEN"
```

Replace `ADDRESS` and `TOKEN` with the values you copied previously.

### [Using Postman to access a forwarded port](#using-postman-to-access-a-forwarded-port)

1.  Open Postman.
    
2.  Create a new GET request.
    
3.  Paste the address you copied previously as the request URL.
    
    ![Screenshot of the URL for the forwarded port, pasted into Postman as the GET request URL. The URL is highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-52934/images/help/codespaces/postman-screenshot-url.png)
    
4.  In the **Headers** tab, create a new entry where the key is "X-Github-Token" and the value is the `GITHUB_TOKEN` you copied previously.
    
    ![Screenshot of a dummy GITHUB_TOKEN, pasted into Postman as the value of the X-GitHub-Token key. The key and value are highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-60353/images/help/codespaces/postman-screenshot-key-token.png)
    
5.  Click **Send**.

## [Automatically forwarding a port](#automatically-forwarding-a-port)

You can add a forwarded port to the GitHub Codespaces configuration for the repository, so that the port will be automatically forwarded for all codespaces created from the repository. After you update the configuration, any previously created codespaces must be rebuilt for the change to apply. For more information about the dev container configuration file, see [Introduction to dev containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#applying-configuration-changes-to-a-codespace).

1.  In your codespace, open the dev container configuration file you want to update. Typically this file is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
    
2.  Add the `forwardPorts` property.
    
    ```
    "forwardPorts": [NUMBER],
    ```
    
    Replace `NUMBER` with the port number you want to forward. This can be a comma-separated list of port numbers.
    
3.  Save the file.

## [Labeling a port](#labeling-a-port)

When you open a codespace in the browser, or in the VS Code desktop application, you can label a forwarded port to make it easier to identify in a list.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port you want to label, then click **Set Port Label**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Set Port Label" option highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59892/images/help/codespaces/set-port-label.png)
    
4.  Type a label for your port, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the label "Staging" added as a custom label for a forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10327/images/help/codespaces/label-text-box.png)

### [Automatically labeling a forwarded port](#automatically-labeling-a-forwarded-port)

You can label a port and write the change to a dev container configuration file for the repository. If you do this for a port that is automatically forwarded, using the `forwardPorts` property, then the label will be automatically applied to that forwarded port for all future codespaces created from the repository using that configuration file.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port whose label attribute you want to add to the codespace configuration, then click **Set Label and Update devcontainer.json**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Set Label and Update devcontainer.json" option highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59898/images/help/codespaces/update-devcontainer-to-add-port-option.png)
    
4.  Type a label for your port, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the label "Staging" added as a custom label for a forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10327/images/help/codespaces/label-text-box.png)
    
5.  If your repository has more than one dev container configuration file, you will be prompted to choose which file you want to update.
    
    The dev container configuration file is updated to include the new label in the `portsAttributes` property. For example:
    
    ```
    // Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
    "forwardPorts": [3333, 4444],
    
    "portsAttributes": {
      "3333": {
        "label": "app-standard-preview"
      },
      "4444": {
        "label": "app-pro-preview"
      }
    }
    ```

When an application running inside a codespace prints output to the terminal that contains a localhost URL, such as `http://localhost:PORT` or `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, the port is automatically forwarded. If you're using GitHub Codespaces in the browser or in Visual Studio Code, the URL string in the terminal is converted into a link that you can click to view the web page on your local machine. By default, GitHub Codespaces forwards ports using HTTP.

You can edit the dev container configuration for the repository to automatically forward one or more ports. You can also forward a port manually, label forwarded ports, share forwarded ports with members of your organization, share forwarded ports publicly, and add forwarded ports to the codespace configuration.

## [Forwarding a port](#forwarding-a-port-1)

You can manually forward a port that wasn't forwarded automatically.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Under the list of ports, click **Add port**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the "Add port" button for a codespace.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-3926/images/help/codespaces/add-port-button.png)
    
4.  Type the port number or address, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the number 3000 being entered into the port number field for a new forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-9504/images/help/codespaces/port-number-text-box.png)

    ![Screenshot of the label "Staging" added as a custom label for a forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10327/images/help/codespaces/label-text-box.png)
    
5.  If your repository has more than one dev container configuration file, you will be prompted to choose which file you want to update.
    
    The dev container configuration file is updated to include the new label in the `portsAttributes` property. For example:
    
    ```
    // Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
    "forwardPorts": [3333, 4444],
    
    "portsAttributes": {
      "3333": {
        "label": "app-standard-preview"
      },
      "4444": {
        "label": "app-pro-preview"
      }
    }
    ```

To forward a port use the `gh codespace ports forward` subcommand. Replace `codespace-port:local-port` with the remote and local ports that you want to connect. After entering the command choose from the list of codespaces that's displayed.

```
gh codespace ports forward CODESPACE-PORT:LOCAL-PORT
```

For more information about this command, see [the GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_codespace_ports_forward).

To see details of forwarded ports enter `gh codespace ports` and then choose a codespace.

## [Sharing a port](#sharing-a-port-2)

Note

You can only make a port private to an organization if your organization uses GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

If you want to share a forwarded port with others, you can either make the port private to your organization or make the port public. After you make a port private to your organization, anyone in the organization with the port's URL can view the running application. After you make a port public, anyone who knows the URL and port number can view the running application without needing to authenticate.

To change the visibility of a forwarded port, use the `gh codespace ports visibility` subcommand. There are three visibility settings:

*   `private` - Visible only to you. This is the default setting when you forward a port.
*   `org` - Visible to members of the organization that owns the repository.
*   `public` - Visible to anyone who knows the URL and port number.

Replace `codespace-port` with the forwarded port number. Replace `setting` with `private`, `org`, or `public`. After entering the command choose from the list of codespaces that's displayed.

```
gh codespace ports visibility CODESPACE-PORT:SETTINGS
```

You can set the visibility for multiple ports with one command. For example:

```
gh codespace ports visibility 80:private 3000:public 3306:org
```

For more information about this command, see [the GitHub CLI manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_codespace_ports_visibility).

## [Using command-line tools and REST clients to access ports](#using-command-line-tools-and-rest-clients-to-access-ports-2)

When you forward a port, your application becomes available at the URL `https://CODESPACENAME-PORT.app.github.dev`. For example, `https://monalisa-hot-potato-vrpqrxxrx7x2rxx-4000.app.github.dev`. If you forward a private port from the VS Code desktop application, your application will also be available at a localhost port such as `127.0.0.1:4000`.

To access your application using a REST client, such as Postman, or a command-line tool like curl, you don't need to authenticate if you're using a localhost port, or if you're accessing a public port at the remote domain. However, to connect to a private port at the remote domain, you must authenticate by using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access token in your request.

Note

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically created when you start a codespace and remains the same for the duration of the codespace session. If you stop and then restart a codespace a new `GITHUB_TOKEN` is generated.

### [Finding the address to connect to](#finding-the-address-to-connect-to-2)

To find the address for a forwarded port, enter `gh codespace ports`. If you have more than one codespace, select the appropriate codespace from the list that's displayed.

Copy the address and paste it somewhere for later use.

### [Finding the GITHUB\_TOKEN](#finding-the-github_token-2)

1.  Start an SSH session for your codespace.
    
    ```
    gh codespace ssh
    ```
    
2.  If you have more than one codespace, select the appropriate codespace from the list that's displayed.
    
3.  Display the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    
    ```
    echo $GITHUB_TOKEN
    ```
    
    The token is a string beginning `ghu_`.
    
4.  Copy the token.
    
    Important
    
    Don't share this access token with anyone.
    
5.  Exit the SSH session.
    
    ```
    exit
    ```

### [Using curl to access a forwarded port](#using-curl-to-access-a-forwarded-port-2)

In a terminal on your local computer, enter:

```
curl ADDRESS -H "X-Github-Token: TOKEN"
```

Replace `ADDRESS` and `TOKEN` with the values you copied previously.

### [Using Postman to access a forwarded port](#using-postman-to-access-a-forwarded-port-2)

1.  Open Postman.
    
2.  Create a new GET request.
    
3.  Paste the address you copied previously as the request URL.
    
    ![Screenshot of the URL for the forwarded port, pasted into Postman as the GET request URL. The URL is highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-52934/images/help/codespaces/postman-screenshot-url.png)
    
4.  In the **Headers** tab, create a new entry where the key is "X-Github-Token" and the value is the `GITHUB_TOKEN` you copied previously.
    
    ![Screenshot of a dummy GITHUB_TOKEN, pasted into Postman as the value of the X-GitHub-Token key. The key and value are highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-60353/images/help/codespaces/postman-screenshot-key-token.png)
    
5.  Click **Send**.

## [Automatically forwarding a port](#automatically-forwarding-a-port-2)

You can add a forwarded port to the GitHub Codespaces configuration for the repository, so that the port will be automatically forwarded for all codespaces created from the repository. After you update the configuration, any previously created codespaces must be rebuilt for the change to apply. For more information about the dev container configuration file, see [Introduction to dev containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#applying-configuration-changes-to-a-codespace).

1.  In your codespace, open the dev container configuration file you want to update. Typically this file is `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
    
2.  Add the `forwardPorts` property.
    
    ```
    "forwardPorts": [NUMBER],
    ```
    
    Replace `NUMBER` with the port number you want to forward. This can be a comma-separated list of port numbers.
    
3.  Save the file.

## [Labeling a port](#labeling-a-port-2)

When you open a codespace in the browser, or in the VS Code desktop application, you can label a forwarded port to make it easier to identify in a list.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port you want to label, then click **Set Port Label**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Set Port Label" option highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59892/images/help/codespaces/set-port-label.png)
    
4.  Type a label for your port, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the label "Staging" added as a custom label for a forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10327/images/help/codespaces/label-text-box.png)

### [Automatically labeling a forwarded port](#automatically-labeling-a-forwarded-port-2)

You can label a port and write the change to a dev container configuration file for the repository. If you do this for a port that is automatically forwarded, using the `forwardPorts` property, then the label will be automatically applied to that forwarded port for all future codespaces created from the repository using that configuration file.

1.  Open the terminal in your codespace.
    
2.  Click the **PORTS** tab.
    
3.  Right-click the port whose label attribute you want to add to the codespace configuration, then click **Set Label and Update devcontainer.json**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Set Label and Update devcontainer.json" option highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59898/images/help/codespaces/update-devcontainer-to-add-port-option.png)
    
4.  Type a label for your port, then press Enter.
    
    ![Screenshot of the label "Staging" added as a custom label for a forwarded port.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-10327/images/help/codespaces/label-text-box.png)
    
5.  If your repository has more than one dev container configuration file, you will be prompted to choose which file you want to update.
    
    The dev container configuration file is updated to include the new label in the `portsAttributes` property. For example:
    
    ```
    // Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
    "forwardPorts": [3333, 4444],
    
    "portsAttributes": {
      "3333": {
        "label": "app-standard-preview"
      },
      "4444": {
        "label": "app-pro-preview"
      }
    }
    ```

### [Seeing port labels on the command line](#seeing-port-labels-on-the-command-line)

You can see the port labels when you list the forwarded ports for a codespace. To do this, use the `gh codespace ports` command and then select a codespace.

## [Troubleshooting issues caused by version incompatibility](#troubleshooting-issues-caused-by-version-incompatibility)

Changes to Copilot Chat coincide with Visual Studio Code releases, due to Copilot Chat's deep UI integration. As a result, every new version of Copilot Chat is only compatible with the latest release of Visual Studio Code. This means that if you are using an older version of Visual Studio Code, you will not be able to use the latest Copilot Chat.

Only the latest Copilot Chat versions will use the latest large language model provided by the Copilot service, as even minor model upgrades require prompt changes and fixes in the extension. An older version of Copilot Chat will still use the latest version of Copilot code completion.

To use Copilot Chat, make sure you are using the [latest version of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates).

## [Troubleshooting authentication issues in your editor](#troubleshooting-authentication-issues-in-your-editor)

If you're using a Copilot plan for a managed user account on GHE.com, you'll need to update some settings before you sign in. See [Using GitHub Copilot with an account on GHE.com](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/using-github-copilot-with-an-account-on-ghecom).

### [Troubleshooting authentication issues in Visual Studio Code](#troubleshooting-authentication-issues-in-visual-studio-code)

If you are signed in to GitHub but Copilot is unavailable in Visual Studio Code, it may be due to an authentication problem. Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1.  In the bottom left corner of the Visual Studio Code window, click the **Accounts** icon, hover over your GitHub username, and click the **Sign out** button.
2.  To reload Visual Studio Code, press F1 to open the command palette, and select **Developer: Reload Window**.

## [About GitHub Copilot Chat](#about-github-copilot-chat)

GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you interact with GitHub Copilot, to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions within the GitHub website and supported IDEs. The chat interface provides access to coding information and support without requiring you to navigate documentation or search online forums. For more information, see [What is GitHub Copilot?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot).

GitHub Copilot Chat can answer a wide range of coding-related questions on topics including syntax, programming concepts, test cases, debugging, and more. GitHub Copilot Chat is not designed to answer non-coding questions or provide general information on topics outside of coding.

The primary supported language for GitHub Copilot Chat is English.

GitHub Copilot Chat works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your question and provide you with an answer. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.

### [Input processing](#input-processing)

The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by the Copilot Chat system, combined with contextual information (for example, the name of the repository the user is currently viewing and the files the user has open), and sent to a large language model. User input can take the form of code snippets or plain language.

Addtional contextual information can be automatically added to chat prompts from an optional `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file that the user can create. This additional information is not displayed in the chat, but if the instructions are sent to the model, the file is listed as a reference in the chat response. The user can disable this feature in the Copilot extension settings.

The large language model will take the prompt, gather additional context (for example repository data stored on GitHub), and provide a response based on the prompt. The system is only intended to respond to coding-related questions.

### [Language model analysis](#language-model-analysis)

The pre-processed prompt is then passed through the Copilot Chat language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt.

### [Response generation](#response-generation)

The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt and the context provided to it.

## [Limitations of GitHub Copilot Chat](#limitations-of-github-copilot-chat)

Depending on factors such as your codebase and input data, you may experience different levels of performance when using Copilot Chat. The following information is designed to help you understand system limitations and key concepts about performance as they apply to Copilot Chat.

### [Limited scope](#limited-scope)

Copilot Chat has been trained on a large body of code but still has a limited scope and may not be able to handle more complex code structures or obscure programming languages. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may be more challenging for Copilot Chat to provide assistance with. Additionally, Copilot Chat can only suggest code based on the context of the code being written, so it may not be able to identify larger design or architectural issues.

### [Potential biases](#potential-biases)

Copilot's training data is drawn from existing code repositories, which may contain biases and errors that can be perpetuated by the tool. Additionally, Copilot Chat may be biased towards certain programming languages or coding styles, which can lead to suboptimal or incomplete code suggestions.

### [Security risks](#security-risks)

Copilot Chat generates code based on the context of the code being written, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using Copilot Chat to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly.

### [Matches with public code](#matches-with-public-code)

Copilot Chat is capable of generating new code, which it does in a probabilistic way. While the probability that it may produce code that matches code in the training set is low, a Copilot Chat suggestion may contain some code snippets that match code in the training set.

If you have disabled suggestions that match public code then Copilot Chat utilizes filters that prevent it from showing code that matches code found in public repositories on GitHub. However, you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

If you have enabled suggestions that match public code then Copilot Chat displays a message if matching code is found. The message includes a link that allows you to show the details of the matched code, and any license details that were found, in the VS Code editor. For more information, see [Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).

Copilot Chat utilizes filters that block matches with public code on GitHub repositories, but you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

Copilot Chat generates code based on the context of the code being written, which can potentially expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities if not used carefully. You should be careful when using Copilot Chat to generate code for security-sensitive applications and always review and test the generated code thoroughly.

### [Matches with public code](#matches-with-public-code-2)

Copilot Chat is capable of generating new code, which it does in a probabilistic way. While the probability that it may produce code that matches code in the training set is low, a Copilot Chat suggestion may contain some code snippets that match code in the training set.

If you have disabled suggestions that match public code then Copilot Chat utilizes filters that prevent it from showing code that matches code found in public repositories on GitHub. However, you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

If you have enabled suggestions that match public code then Copilot Chat displays a message if matching code is found. The message includes a link that allows you to show the details of the matched code, and any license details that were found, in the VS Code editor. For more information, see [Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).

Copilot Chat utilizes filters that block matches with public code on GitHub repositories, but you should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities. You should make sure your IDE or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

# GitHub Community Code of Conduct - GitHub Docs

## [Overview and Purpose](#overview-and-purpose)

Millions of developers across the world host millions of projects—both open and closed source—on GitHub. We're fortunate to be able to play a part in enabling collaboration across the developer community every day, which is a responsibility we don’t take lightly. Together, we all have the exciting opportunity to make this a community we can be proud of.

GitHub Community, powered by GitHub Discussions, is intended to be a place for further collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for connecting with other users, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need for your GitHub projects. By participating in GitHub Community, you are agreeing to the same [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) that apply to GitHub.com, as well as this GitHub Community-specific Code of Conduct.

With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in GitHub Community, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from community participation. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within GitHub Community that we determine to be in violation of either the GitHub Terms of Service or this Code of Conduct.

Our diverse user base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created their first "Hello World" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for developers to do their best work.

## [Pledge](#pledge)

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in GitHub Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## [Standards](#standards)

Treat GitHub Community with respect. We are a shared resource — a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.

The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

### [_Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community_](#best-practices-for-maintaining-a-strong-community)

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

*   Engage with consideration and respect.
    
    *   **Be welcoming and open-minded** - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
        
    *   **Be respectful** - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.
        
    *   **Be empathetic** - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
        
*   Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
    
    *   **Improve the discussion.** Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
        
        The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.
        
    *   **Be clear and stay on topic.** GitHub Community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.
        
        This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in GitHub Community discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.
        
    *   **Share mindfully.** When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.
        
        Additionally, don't share sensitive information. This includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in GitHub Community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other GitHub users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists. By sharing the link to your project repo - with some information on what your project is and what kind of help or feedback you're looking for - you can invite others to collaborate with you via issues or pull requests without having to share your private information. You can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.
        
    *   **Keep it tidy.** Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:
        
        *   Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
        *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
        *   Don’t post no-content replies.
        *   Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
        *   Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.
        
        Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.
        
*   Be trustworthy.
    
    *   **Always be honest.** Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other GitHub Community participants. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. GitHub staff will also be active in GitHub Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.

### [_What is not Allowed_](#what-is-not-allowed)

GitHub's [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), which are part of GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), set a baseline for what is not allowed on GitHub. Since GitHub Community is on GitHub.com, these terms and restrictions apply to GitHub Community, including the following restrictions:

*   **Anyone under the age of 13.** If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your GitHub.com account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) for information about account termination.
    
*   **Creating new account after account restriction.** GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) state that "One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account." Additional free accounts created to inquire about flagged or suspended accounts in GitHub will be removed.
    
*   **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.** GitHub Community is a professional space and should be treated as such.
    
*   **Violation of Terms of Service.** If your GitHub.com account is identified in violation of [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) we will have to close your account.

### [_Reasonable use of AI generated content_](#reasonable-use-of-ai-generated-content)

We love experimenting with new technologies, and we are especially fond of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). But as with all new technology, many of us are still getting accustomed to using generative AI tools the most effectively. Here are important guidelines to follow when using generative AI to answer questions in the community:

*   Take personal responsibility for everything you post.
*   Read and revise the content before you post it; use your own authentic voice.
*   Use your expertise as a developer to verify that the answer works and makes sense.
*   Do not just post AI-generated content verbatim to inflate your reputation or give a false impression of product expertise.
*   AI tools will often answer in an authoritative tone that sounds like a tech support professional. Be careful not to [mislead other users](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-impersonation) into thinking that this authoritative tone means they are receiving an official response from GitHub.

Additionally, all of the guidelines listed in the previous section ([Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct#best-practices-for-maintaining-a-strong-community)) also apply here.

The community is here for users to build trust through authentic reputations. Not adhering to these guidelines may, in some cases, constitute a Code of Conduct violation. Refer to [the enforcement section](#enforcement) below for more information.

## [Enforcement](#enforcement)

*   **If you see a problem, report it.** Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this GitHub Community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
    
    When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. You can report a disruptive user or disruptive content to GitHub. For more information, see [Reporting abuse or spam](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam).

### [Our Responsibilities](#our-responsibilities)

There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble.

Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decision.

Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:

*   Content Removal
*   Content Blocking
*   GitHub Account Suspension
*   GitHub Account Termination

GitHub Community moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the GitHub Community's leadership.

If, for any reason, you want to contact GitHub Staff, the Community Managers, Administrators, or Moderators of GitHub Community privately, you can contact GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). Contacting any member of GitHub Staff via unsolicited mentions or pings, or via channels other than GitHub Community itself, or the Support contact form is strongly discouraged and may be considered a violation of our prohibition against harassment.

Let's work together to keep GitHub Community a place where people feel safe to participate by being respectful of them and their time.

## [Legal Notices](#legal-notices)

Yes, legalese is boring, but we must protect ourselves – and by extension, you and your data – against unfriendly folks. We have a [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), which includes our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), and our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) describing your (and our) behavior and rights related to content, privacy, and laws. To use this service, you must agree to abide by our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) and the [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

This Code of Conduct does not modify our [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)—which includes our [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)—and is not intended to be a complete list. GitHub retains full discretion under the [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) to remove or restrict any content or accounts for activity that violates those policies, including because it is unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or violates any party's intellectual property or our Terms of Service. This Code of Conduct describes when we will exercise that discretion.

### [Data Retention and Deletion of Data](#data-retention-and-deletion-of-data)

If you're a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) or contacting GitHub Support through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. For more information please see the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-event-code-of-conduct

# GitHub Event Code of Conduct - GitHub Docs

## [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

By attending a GitHub event, including any of the events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the GitHub event (collectively the "Event"), you represent that you have read, understand, and agree to the following GitHub Event Code of Conduct (hereinafter “Code of Conduct”). This Code of Conduct applies to all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, sponsors, organizers, staff, and volunteers (collectively “Event Participants”) at the Event.

GitHub values the participation of all Event Participants and aims to create an event where all Event Participants have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all Event Participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other Event Participants throughout the Event.

GitHub is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience.

We do not tolerate harassment of Event Participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to an Event Participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication and behavior should be appropriate for a professional setting including people of many different backgrounds.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for everyone at the Event
*   Showing empathy towards others and Event Participants

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery
*   Inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments or behavior
*   Personal or political attacks toward Event Participants
*   Sustained disruption of talks or any other events or activities organized by GitHub in association with the Event
*   Intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing of Event Participants
*   Photography or recording of Event Participants without their consent
*   Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner
*   Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Each Event Participant is entirely responsible for their own actions.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

## [Reporting an incident](#reporting-an-incident)

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, have any other concerns, or if you believe an Event Participant is not acting in a way compliant with this Code of Conduct, please speak directly with a venue security officer or GitHub employee for urgent help, or email us at [events@github.com](mailto:events@github.com) for non-urgent issues. For life threatening situations, please dial 911 immediately.

GitHub employees will be happy to help Event Participants contact security or local law enforcement, escort to safety, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the Event.

## https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# About code owners - GitHub Docs

You can use a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

## Who can use this feature?

People with write permissions for the repository can create or edit the CODEOWNERS file and be listed as code owners. People with admin or owner permissions can require that pull requests have to be approved by code owners before they can be merged.

You can define code owners in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [GitHub’s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).

The people you choose as code owners must have write permissions for the repository. When the code owner is a team, that team must be visible and it must have write permissions, even if all the individual members of the team already have write permissions directly, through organization membership, or through another team membership.

## [About code owners](#about-code-owners)

Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. Code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. For more information about draft pull requests, see [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). When you mark a draft pull request as ready for review, code owners are automatically notified. If you convert a pull request to a draft, people who are already subscribed to notifications are not automatically unsubscribed. For more information, see [Changing the stage of a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).

When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository. For more information, see [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging).

If a file has a code owner, you can see who the code owner is before you open a pull request. In the repository, you can browse to the file and hover over to see a tool tip with codeownership details.

![Screenshot showing the header for a file. The cursor hovers over a shield icon with the tooltip "Owned by USER or TEAM (from CODEOWNERS line NUMBER)."](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-28326/images/help/repository/code-owner-for-a-file.png)

## [CODEOWNERS file location](#codeowners-file-location)

To use a CODEOWNERS file, create a new file called `CODEOWNERS` in the `.github/`, root, or `docs/` directory of the repository, in the branch where you'd like to add the code owners. If `CODEOWNERS` files exist in more than one of those locations, GitHub will search for them in that order and use the first one it finds.

Each CODEOWNERS file assigns the code owners for a single branch in the repository. Thus, you can assign different code owners for different branches, such as `@octo-org/codeowners-team` for a code base on the default branch and `@octocat` for a GitHub Pages site on the `gh-pages` branch.

For code owners to receive review requests, the CODEOWNERS file must be on the base branch of the pull request. For example, if you assign `@octocat` as the code owner for _.js_ files on the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, `@octocat` will receive review requests when a pull request with changes to _.js_ files is opened between the head branch and `gh-pages`.

## [CODEOWNERS and forks](#codeowners-and-forks)

To trigger review requests, pull requests use the version of `CODEOWNERS` from the base branch of the pull request. The base branch is the branch that a pull request will modify if the pull request is merged.

If you create a pull request from a fork, and the base branch is in the upstream repository, then the pull request will use the `CODEOWNERS` file from that branch in the upstream repository. If the base branch is a branch within your fork, then the pull request will use the `CODEOWNERS` file from that branch in your fork, but this will only trigger review requests if the code owners are added to your fork specifically with `write` access.

When you view who is responsible for a file by hovering over , you will see information from the `CODEOWNERS` file for whichever branch in whichever repository you're looking at.

## [CODEOWNERS file size](#codeowners-file-size)

CODEOWNERS files must be under 3 MB in size. A CODEOWNERS file over this limit will not be loaded, which means that code owner information is not shown and the appropriate code owners will not be requested to review changes in a pull request.

To reduce the size of your CODEOWNERS file, consider using wildcard patterns to consolidate multiple entries into a single entry.

## [CODEOWNERS syntax](#codeowners-syntax)

Warning

There are some syntax rules for gitignore files that _do not work_ in CODEOWNERS files:

*   Escaping a pattern starting with `#` using `\` so it is treated as a pattern and not a comment doesn't work
*   Using `!` to negate a pattern doesn't work
*   Using `[ ]` to define a character range doesn't work

A CODEOWNERS file uses a pattern that follows most of the same rules used in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) files. The pattern is followed by one or more GitHub usernames or team names using the standard `@username` or `@org/team-name` format. Users and teams must have explicit `write` access to the repository, even if the team's members already have access.

If you want to match two or more code owners with the same pattern, all the code owners must be on the same line. If the code owners are not on the same line, the pattern matches only the last mentioned code owner.

In most cases, you can also refer to a user by an email address that has been added to their account, for example `user@example.com`. You cannot use an email address to refer to a managed user account. For more information about managed user accounts, see [About Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

CODEOWNERS paths are case sensitive, because GitHub uses a case sensitive file system. Since CODEOWNERS are evaluated by GitHub, even systems that are case insensitive (for example, macOS) must use paths and files that are cased correctly in the CODEOWNERS file.

If any line in your CODEOWNERS file contains invalid syntax, that line will be skipped. When you navigate to the CODEOWNERS file in your repository, you can see any errors highlighted. A list of errors in a repository's CODEOWNERS file is also accessible via the API. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#list-codeowners-errors).

If you specify a user or team that doesn't exist or has insufficient access, a code owner will not be assigned.

### [Example of a CODEOWNERS file](#example-of-a-codeowners-file)

```
# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner #This is an inline comment.

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
*.go docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
*.txt @octo-org/octocats

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/* docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @doctocat

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
/scripts/ @doctocat @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as
# `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes
# in a `/logs` directory will require approval from @octocat.
**/logs @octocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty. Without an owner, changes
# to `apps/github` can be made with the approval of any user who has
# write access to the repository.
/apps/ @octocat
/apps/github

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as this subdirectory has its own owner @doctocat
/apps/ @octocat
/apps/github @doctocat
```

## [CODEOWNERS and branch protection](#codeowners-and-branch-protection)

Repository owners can update branch protection rules to ensure that changed code is reviewed by the owners of the changed files. Edit your branch protection rule and enable the option "Require review from Code Owners". For more information, see [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).

Note

When reviews from code owners are required, an approval from _any_ of the owners is sufficient to meet this requirement. For example, let's say that your CODEOWNERS file contains the following line:

```
*.js     @global-owner1 @global-owner2
```

This means that changes to JavaScript files could be approved by either `@global-owner1` _or_ `@global-owner2`, but approvals from _both_ are not required.

To protect a repository fully against unauthorized changes, you also need to define an owner for the CODEOWNERS file itself. The most secure method is to define a CODEOWNERS file in the `.github` directory of the repository and define the repository owner as the owner of either the CODEOWNERS file (`/.github/CODEOWNERS @owner_username`) or the whole directory (`/.github/ @owner_username`).

As an alternative to branch protection rules, you can create rulesets. Rulesets have a few advantages over branch protection rules, such as statuses, and better discoverability without requiring admin access. You can also apply multiple rulesets at the same time. For more information, see [About rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

# GitHub Copilot in VS Code

In this article

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant integrated into Visual Studio Code. It provides code suggestions, explanations, and automated implementations based on natural language prompts and existing code context. Copilot has been trained on public code repositories and can assist with most programming languages and frameworks.

## Core capabilities

### Code completions

Copilot provides inline code suggestions as you type, ranging from single line completions to entire function implementations. With next edit suggestions, it predicts the next logical code change based on your current context.

**Examples:**

*   Type `function calculateTax(` to get a complete tax calculation implementation
*   Write `// Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication` to generate Express.js route code
*   Begin a React component with `const UserProfile = ({` to receive a complete functional component with TypeScript types

Learn more about [code completions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions).

### Autonomous coding

VS Code and agent mode can autonomously plan and execute complex development tasks, coordinating multi-step workflows that involve running terminal commands or invoking specialized tools. It can transform high-level requirements into working code.

Install Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers or tools from Marketplace extensions to further enhance the capabilities of the autonomous coding experience. For example, pull information from a database or connect to external APIs.

**Example tasks:**

*   Implement authentication using OAuth
*   Migrate the codebase to a new framework or language
*   Debug failing tests and apply fixes
*   Optimize performance across the application

Learn more about [autonomous coding with agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) and [configuring MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

### Natural language chat

Use natural language to interact with your codebase through chat interfaces. Ask questions, request explanations, or specify code changes using conversational prompts.

Apply changes across multiple files in your project using single prompts. Copilot analyzes your project structure and makes coordinated modifications.

**Common queries:**

*   "How does authentication work in this project?"
*   "What's causing the memory leak in the data processing function?"
*   "Add error handling to the payment processing service"
*   "Add a login form and backend API"

Learn more about [using chat in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat).

### Smart actions

VS Code has many predefined actions for common development tasks that are enhanced with AI capabilities and integrated into the editor.

From helping you write commit messages or pull requests descriptions, renaming code symbols, fixing errors in the editor, to semantic search that helps you find relevant files.

# Get started with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

In this article

Visual Studio Code has rich AI features powered by GitHub. In this tutorial, you discover how to use AI while coding in the editor, to ask questions about your code, and to start an editing session to make changes across multiple files.

While we're using JavaScript and TypeScript for this tutorial, note that Copilot is also trained on numerous other languages and a wide variety of frameworks.

## Prerequisites

*   VS Code installed on your machine. Download it from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    
*   Access to GitHub Copilot. Follow these steps to [Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).
    
    Tip
    
    If you don't have a Copilot subscription or have a seat assigned by your organization, you can sign up to use Copilot for free directly from within VS Code and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Get your first code suggestion

To get started with AI features in VS Code, you don't have to do anything special. As you're typing code in the editor, Copilot automatically presents you code suggestions (_code completions_) in the editor to help you code more efficiently.

1.  Open VS Code and create a new JavaScript file `calculator.js`.
    
2.  In the JavaScript file, start typing the following code:
    
    ```
    class Calculator
    ```
    
    Notice that as you type, you automatically get code suggestions for the implementation of the `Calculator` class in gray dimmed text (ghost text). The exact suggestions you receive might vary because large language models are non-deterministic.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing Copilot suggesting the  method inside the  class.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-code-completion.png)
    
3.  To accept the suggestion, press the Tab key.
    
    Congratulations! You've just accepted your first AI-powered code suggestion. As you continue typing, Copilot updates the code suggestion accordingly.
    
4.  For any given input, there might be multiple suggestions. Type the following code inside the class to add a `factorial` method:
    
    ```
    factorial(n) {
    ```
    
5.  Hover over the suggestion in the editor and notice that there are multiple suggestions.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing Copilot giving multiple suggestions for  when hovering over it.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-code-completion-multiple.png)
    
    You can use the arrow controls or use the keyboard shortcuts to show the next (⌥\] (Windows, Linux Alt+\])) or previous (⌥\[ (Windows, Linux Alt+\[)) suggestion.

AI-powered code completions can help you with generating boilerplate or repetitive code, letting you stay in the developer flow and focus on more complex coding tasks.

## Use editor inline chat to generate a basic web server

With chat-based AI, you can use natural language to ask questions about your code or to ask it to generate code for you. _Editor inline chat_ provides a chat interface directly in the editor, so you can prompt about the code in the active editor.

Let's use editor inline chat to help generate a basic Express web server.

1.  First, add a new TypeScript file `server.ts` to your workspace.
    
2.  Now, press ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) on your keyboard to bring up editor inline chat.
    
    Editor inline chat gives you a chat interface that lets you ask questions about the code in the active editor or generate code for you.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Copilot Inline Chat control.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-inline-chat.png)
    
3.  Type "add a simple express web server" in the chat input field, and press Enter to submit the prompt.
    
    Notice that the code changes start streaming directly in the editor. The response is an implementation for a simple Node.js Express web server.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the inline chat response for adding an Express web server.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-inline-chat-express-server.png)
    
4.  Select **Accept** or press ⌘Enter (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Enter) to apply the proposed code changes.
    
    Congratulations! You've used editor inline chat for generating code using chat and natural language.

## Refactor your code through AI chat

You can also use editor inline chat to refactor or improve existing code in the editor.

Notice that the generated web server is currently using a static port number `3000`. Let's change this to use an environment variable instead.

1.  In the editor, select the `3000` port number in the `server.ts` file, and then press ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) to open inline chat.
    
2.  Type "use an environment variable for the port number" in the chat input field, and press Enter to send the chat request or prompt.
    
    Notice how the existing code is updated to use an environment variable for the port number.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing editor inline chat to use an environment variable for the port number.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-inline-chat-refactor-port.png)
    
3.  Select **Accept** or press ⌘Enter (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Enter) to apply the proposed code changes.
    
4.  If you're not happy with a proposed change, you can modify the prompt and keep iterating to get a different solution. For example, ask to use a different environment variable name for the port number.

## Use chat for general programming questions

As you're working in a new codebase, or exploring a new programming language, you might have more general coding questions come up. By using chat, you can have a chat conversation on the side, which keeps track of the history of your questions.

1.  Open the Chat view from the Copilot menu in the title bar or press ⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I).
    
    ![Screenshot of the VS Code editor, showing the Copilot menu, highlighting the Open Chat option.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-chat-menu-command-center.png)
    
2.  You can use chat in different ways. Select **Ask** from the mode dropdown to ask questions.
    
    In a later step, you'll use chat to start an editing session and make changes across multiple files.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the dropdown to to change the chat mode to 'Ask'.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-chat-ask-mode.png)
    
    Tip
    
    You can change the language model that is used in chat by choosing a different model from the dropdown.
    
3.  Type "what is recursion?" in the chat input field and press Enter to submit your chat prompt.
    
    Notice how the chat response contains rich results like Markdown text and code blocks.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Chat view containing the answer to what recursion is.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-chat-view-recursion.png)
    
4.  Follow the steps in the [Chat Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat) to learn how you can also use chat to ask questions about your specific codebase.

## Make edits across multiple files

For larger code changes that might involve making edits to multiple files, you can start an AI-powered editing session. Instead of receiving code blocks in the Chat view, the edits are applied directly to your files across your workspace.

Let's start an editing session to return the contents of an HTML file for our web server.

1.  Select **Edit** from the mode dropdown in the Chat view.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the dropdown to to change the chat mode to 'Edit'](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-chat-edit-mode.png)
    
2.  Notice that the `server.ts` file is automatically added as context for your chat prompt.
    
    By adding the file as context to your prompt, the AI model can provide more relevant code edits. Optionally, add more context to your prompt with the **Add Context** button.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing the prompt input field with the  file.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-edits-working-set.png)
    
3.  Enter _Return a static html page as the home page and implement it._ in the chat input field and press Enter to start a new edit session.
    
    Notice that multiple edits are applied to your project: the `server.ts` file now returns the newly created `index.html` HTML page.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the chat response for returning a static HTML page in the web server response.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-edits-html-response.png)
    
4.  If you're happy with the results, select **Keep** to apply all suggested changes.
    
    You can also navigate between the different edited files and accept or reject them by using the editor overlay controls.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the Keep button to apply the changes and the editor overlay controls.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-edits-accept.png)

## Fix coding errors with AI

Aside from inline suggestions and chat conversations, AI features are available in different areas throughout your developer flow in VS Code. You might notice the presence of AI functionality through the _sparkle_ icon in the VS Code user interface.

One such place is the editor, whenever there's a red squiggle due to a compiler error. Let's use AI to fix a coding error.

1.  Open the `server.ts` TypeScript file that you created earlier in the editor.
    
    Notice that the `import express from 'express';` statement contains a red squiggle. If you put the cursor on the red squiggle, you can see the sparkle icon appear.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Copilot sparkle because of an error with the express import statement.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-code-action-sparkle.png)
    
2.  Select the sparkle icon to view the AI Code Actions, and then select **Fix using Copilot**.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Copilot code actions, highlighting .](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-code-action-fix.png)
    
3.  Notice that editor inline chat comes up, prepopulated with the error message, and a solution to fix the problem.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Copilot Inline Chat proposing to install the express npm package to solve the problem.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/getting-started/copilot-code-action-fix-result.png)
    
    Directly from the chat response, you can optionally select the **Insert into Terminal** button to copy the proposed command in your terminal.

# Use chat in VS Code

In this article

Use chat in Visual Studio Code to ask about your codebase or make edits across your project by using natural language. Chat can operate in different modes, optimized for your use case, from asking questions to making multi-file edits or starting an autonomous coding workflow.

You might want to use chat in VS Code when you need to:

*   Understand code - "Explain how this authentication middleware works"
*   Debug issues - "Why am I getting a null reference in this loop?"
*   Get code suggestions - "Show me how to implement a binary search tree in Python"
*   Optimize performance - "Help me improve the efficiency of this database query"
*   Learn best practices - "What's the recommended way to handle errors in async functions?"
*   Get VS Code tips - "How do I customize keyboard shortcuts?"

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Access chat in VS Code

You can use natural language chat in different ways in VS Code, each optimized for a specific use case and task.

Experience

## Change the language model

VS Code offers different built-in language models to choose from. Some models are optimized for fast coding tasks, while others are better suited for slower planning and reasoning tasks. Use the model picker in the chat input field to change the model that Copilot uses for generating a response.

![Screenshot of the chat model picker in the Chat view, showing a dropdown list of available models.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-model-picker.png)

You can also add models from other model providers (preview) and use them in chat. Get more details about how to [use models from other providers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/language-models#_bring-your-own-language-model-key).

Note

The list of available models might vary based on your Copilot subscription and might change over time. See the GitHub Copilot documentation for more information about the [available language models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat?tool=vscode).

## Submit a chat prompt

Use natural language to make chat requests in VS Code. Depending on the chat mode, you can ask questions about your codebase, get code suggestions, or make code edits across multiple files in your project and invoke specialized tools.

A chat response might contain a combination of rich content such as Markdown text, code blocks, buttons, file trees, and more.

![Copilot Chat view in the Secondary Side Bar and Explorer view in the Primary Side Bar.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view.png)

To get more relevant responses or reference specific files or artifacts in your workspace, such as test failures or terminal output, [add context](#_add-chat-context) to your chat prompt by #-mentioning relevant context items.

## Add chat context

VS Code tries to determine the intent and scope of your chat request based on your natural language prompt. To help get more relevant responses, provide additional context in your chat prompt, such as files, test results, terminal output, and more.

Use the **Add Context** button in the Chat view or type #-mentions to add context to your chat prompt. For example, `#codebase` to refer to the entire codebase, or `#<file | folder | symbol>` to refer to a specific file, folder, or symbol in your workspace. Type `#` in the chat input field to view the list of context items.

![Screenshot of the Chat view with the context menu open](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-add-context.png)

You can also directly reference an agent mode tool in your prompt by typing `#` followed by the tool name. You can do this in all chat modes (ask, edit, and agent mode). For example, use the `#fetch` tool to add the content of a web page as context to your chat prompt, or use `#githubRepo` to perform a code search in a GitHub repository.

Get more details about [adding context to your chat prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context).

## Prompt examples

Ask about general technology topics

*   `"What is a linked list?"`
*   `"top 10 popular web frameworks"`

Understand the codebase

*   `"Explain how authentication works in #codebase"`
*   `"Where is the database connecting string configured? #codebase"`
*   `"How do I build this #codebase?"`
*   `"Where is #getUser used? #usages"`

Add new features to your app

*   `"Create an about page and include it in the nav bar #codebase"`
*   `"Add a new API route for updating the address info #codebase"`
*   `"Add a login button and style it based on #styles.css"`

Fix issues in the workspace

*   `"Fix the issues in #problems"`
*   `"Fix the failing tests #testFailure"`

Reference content from the web

*   `"How do I use the 'useState' hook in react 18? #fetch https://18.react.dev/reference/react/useState#usage"`
*   `"Build an API endpoint to fetch address info, use the template from #githubRepo contoso/api-templates"`

For more prompt examples, see the [Copilot Chat Cookbook](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/example-prompts-for-github-copilot-chat) in the GitHub documentation.

Tip

Type `/help` in the chat input field to get help about Copilot and how to interact with chat.

## Vision

Chat supports vision capabilities, which means you can attach an image as context to your chat prompt and ask questions about it. For example, attach a screenshot of a block of code and ask to explain it, or attach a sketch of a UI and ask agent mode to implement it.

Tip

You can drag and drop an image from a web browser onto the Chat view to add it as context.

## Chat history

As you iterate and send multiple chat prompts in a chat session, VS Code uses the history of chat prompts and responses as context for your current chat prompt. This means that you can ask follow-up questions or clarify your previous question without having to repeat the context. For example, you can ask "How does _this_ differ from ...", "Now add a test case", "explain in more detail", and more.

At any time, you can create a new chat session by using the **New Chat** (`+`) button (⌃L (Windows, Linux Ctrl+L)) in the Chat view. This can be useful if you want to move to a different topic and avoid the previous context and history.

To view the history of chat sessions, select the **Show Chats...** button in the Chat view or by using the **Chat: Show Chats...** command in the Command Palette. Select a history entry to open that chat session in the Chat view and continue the conversation.

![Screenshot of the Chat view with the Show Chats... button highlighted](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view-show-chats.png)

You can export all prompts and responses for a chat session in a JSON file with the **Chat: Export Chat...** command in the Command Palette.

### Revert chat requests

You can revert (undo) chat requests in the active chat session. When you revert a chat request, you also remove the corresponding response from the conversation history.

Reverting a request is useful if you want to remove a specific prompt and response from the conversation history of that session. For example, if you notice that the language model is not providing relevant responses or is taking an unwanted direction.

You have two options to revert a chat request:

*   Undo the last chat request: use the **Undo Last Request** button in the Chat view toolbar.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view with the Undo Last Request button highlighted.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-undo-last-request.png)
    
*   Undo a specific chat request: hover over a chat request in the Chat view and select the **Undo Request (Delete)** (`x`) button next to the request (or press ⌘Backspace (Windows, Linux Delete)). When you undo a request, it also undoes all subsequent requests and responses in the chat session.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Chat view with multiple prompts, highlighting the 'x' control to delete a chat prompt and its response.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-delete-prompt.png)

## Open chat in an editor tab or separate window

You can open a chat session as a separate editor tab, or even as a separate, floating window. This functionality enables you to have multiple chat sessions open at the same time.

In the Chat view, select the `...` icon in the top-right corner, and then select **Open Chat in Editor** or **Open Chat in New Window**.

![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the three-dot menu that contains the Open in Editor and Open in New Window options.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-three-dot-menu.png)

The following screenshot shows the Chat view running in a floating window:

![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the three-dot menu that contains the Open in Editor and Open in New Window options. The desktop shows a floating window with a chat session.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-open-in-new-window.png)

By default, the chat session opens in compact mode, which hides the title bar and other UI elements. Select the compact mode icon in the floating window title bar to toggle between compact and normal mode.

Optionally, enable the **Always on Top** mode to always keep the Chat view on top of other windows.

Learn more about [floating windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/custom-layout#_floating-windows) in VS Code.

## Use voice interactions

With the voice control capabilities in VS Code, provided by the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, you can initiate a chat conversation by using your voice:

*   Use your voice to dictate your chat prompt
*   Use the "Hey Code" voice command to start a voice session with Copilot Chat
*   Accelerate voice input for chat by using the "hold to speak" mode

Learn more about how to [use voice interactions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/accessibility/voice).

## Privacy and transparency

To enable more workspace search features for private repositories, we require additional permissions. If we detect that we don't have these permissions already, we will ask for them at startup. Once granted, we'll securely store the session for the future.

![Modal window asking for additional authentication for a private repository.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/authentication.png)

Learn more about security, privacy, and transparency in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I choose between the different chat modes?

The different chat modes are optimized for different use cases:

*   Use _editor inline chat_ to ask questions or make edits directly in the active editor. This is useful for making code changes or asking questions that are scoped to the active file.
    
*   Use _ask mode_ to ask questions about your codebase or technology concepts. The response might include code suggestions, which you can apply manually and individually to your codebase. Changes are not automatically applied to your codebase.
    
*   Use _edit mode_ to directly apply edits across multiple files in your codebase based on your chat prompt. You provide the relevant context and files for your prompt.
    
*   Use _agent mode_ to start an agentic coding workflow, whereby Copilot autonomously determines the relevant context and files, determines which tasks need to be performed to complete the request. It then iterates independently to achieve the desired outcome, fixing issues as they come up. Agent mode can invoke tools to perform specialized tasks, such as running terminal commands, validating test cases, or accessing APIs.

# Getting started with Copilot Chat in VS Code

In this article

This tutorial walks you through using Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. You use AI-powered chat conversations to help with refactoring code, improving your code understanding, and finding your way around configuring VS Code.

If you're new to using Copilot in VS Code, see the [Copilot Overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) or get set up and discover the key capabilities in the [Copilot Quickstart](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started).

Tip

If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Prerequisites

To use GitHub Copilot in VS Code, you need to have the following:

*   Access to GitHub Copilot
*   GitHub Copilot extensions installed in VS Code

Follow the steps in the [GitHub Copilot set up guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup) to get access to GitHub Copilot and install the Copilot extensions in VS Code.

## Get your first chat conversation

Copilot Chat lets you interact with GitHub Copilot by using natural language, to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions.

In this tutorial, you'll be creating a simple Node.js web application.

1.  Open a new VS Code window. You'll be creating a new workspace in a follow-up step.
    
2.  Select **Open Chat** from the Copilot menu in the title bar or use the ⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I) keyboard shortcut.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Copilot Chat view, highlighting the chat menu in the Command Center.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-menu-command-center.png)
    
    Notice that the Chat view opens in the Secondary Side Bar. Having the Chat view on the side allows you to keep the conversation going while you work on your code.
    
3.  In the Chat view, select **Ask** from the chat mode dropdown.
    
    Use _ask mode_ to ask Copilot questions about coding and technology topics, explain code, or brainstorm ideas.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat view, showing the Ask mode dropdown.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/chat-mode-dropdown-ask.png)
    
4.  Let's ask Copilot about popular web frameworks. Enter "what are the most popular web frameworks?" in the chat input field.
    
    Copilot returns a list of popular web frameworks. Experiment with asking follow-up questions to get more information about a specific framework, or to compare frameworks. For example, you can ask "what are the differences between Express and Fastify?" or "how to do server-side rendering?".
    
5.  To scaffold a new web app, enter "new express app with typescript and pug" in the chat input field.
    
    Notice how Copilot returns a file tree that represents the new workspace files. Select any file in the file tree to preview its content.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat view, showing a file tree for a new workspace and a 'Create Workspace' button.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-view-workspace-file-tree.png)
    
6.  Select **Create Workspace** to create the app, and select a folder on disk where the workspace should be created.
    
    Select **Open** in the dialog to open the newly-created workspace in VS Code.
    
    Note
    
    VS Code might ask if you want to trust the new workspace. Select **Yes, I trust the contents** to trust the workspace. Get more details about [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust).

## Stay in the flow with inline chat

While the Chat view is great for keeping a conversation going, _editor inline chat_ is optimized for situations where you want to ask Copilot about the code you're actively working on in the editor. For example, to refactor a specific piece of code, or explain a complex algorithm.

Let's look at how to use editor inline chat for code refactoring.

1.  Open the `app.ts` file and use the ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) keyboard shortcut to bring up editor inline chat. Alternatively, select **Editor Inline Chat** from the Copilot menu in the title bar.
    
    A chat input field appears inline in the editor, where you can enter your chat prompt and ask Copilot about the code in the editor.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, highlighting the Inline Chat popup control.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-inline-chat-popup.png)
    
2.  Enter "Add support for JSON output" in the chat input field and press Enter.
    
    Notice how Copilot provides a code suggestion to add support for JSON output in Express.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor with the suggested code change.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-inline-chat-json-support.png)
    
3.  Select **Accept** or **Close** to apply or ignore the changes.
    
    If you're not happy with the suggested code changes, you can select the **Rerun Request** control or ask a follow-up question to get another suggestion.

Tip

Right-click in the editor and select the **Copilot** context menu to access commonly used Copilot commands, such as fixing or explaining code or generating tests.

## Make edits across multiple files

With inline chat, you made changes to a single file. You can also use Copilot to make changes across multiple files in your workspace by switching to _edit mode_ in the Chat view.

Let's use edit mode to use a `.env` file to store the configuration for your web app.

1.  Open the Chat view and select **Edit** from the chat mode dropdown.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat view, showing the Edit mode dropdown.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/chat-mode-dropdown-edit.png)
    
2.  To help Copilot understand the scope of your request, let's add `package.json` and `app.ts` as context to the prompt.
    
    1.  Select **Add Context** in the Chat view, type `package` in the search field, and select the `package.json` file from the list of files. Notice that there are many types of context you can add.
        
    2.  Open the `app.ts` file in the editor, and notice that Copilot automatically adds the active file to the chat context.
        
3.  Enter "Use a .env file for configuration" in the chat input field and press Enter.
    
4.  Notice how Copilot makes updates across multiple files and adds a new `.env` file to your workspace.
    
    The Chat view shows the files that were changed in bold text in the Chat view.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the suggested code change in the app.ts file.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-inline-chat-env-file.png)
    
5.  Select **Keep** in the Chat view to confirm all suggested changes.
    
    Use the overlay controls in the editor to easily navigate and review the individual changes across your files.

## Start an agentic coding flow

For more complex requests, you can use _agent mode_ to let Copilot autonomously plan and execute the tasks that are needed to complete your request. These tasks can involve editing code but also include running commands in the terminal. In agent mode, Copilot might invoke different tools to accomplish the task.

Let's use agent mode to make the web app about sharing travel tips and add testing.

1.  Open the Chat view and select **Agent** from the chat mode dropdown.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat view, showing the Agent mode dropdown.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/chat-mode-dropdown-agent.png)
    
2.  Enter "Make the app a travel blog. Add tests to avoid code regression." in the chat input field and press Enter.
    
    Note that you don't need to add context to your prompt. Agent mode automatically analyzes the code in your workspace.
    
3.  Copilot iterates to apply code changes and run commands like running tests. Confirm terminal commands by selecting **Continue** in the Chat view.
    
    ![Screenshot of VS Code editor, showing the Chat view asking to confirm running tests in the terminal.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-agent-terminal.png)
    
    Depending on the complexity of your request, Copilot might take a few minutes to complete all tasks. If it encounters issues along the way, it iterates to fix them.
    
4.  Once Copilot completes the tasks, review the changes, and test the app.
    
    You can also ask Copilot to run the app by giving it a prompt like "Run the app" or "Start the server".

## Congratulations

Congratulations, you successfully used Copilot Chat in VS Code to ask questions and make code edits across your workspace. Continue to experiment with different prompts and chat modes to get the most out of Copilot Chat.

# Manage context for AI

In this article

By providing the right context, you can get more relevant and accurate responses from the AI in VS Code. In this article, you learn how to manage context in chat, including how to use #-mentions to reference files, folders, and symbols, how to reference web content, or how you can use custom instructions to guide the AI's responses.

## Implicit context

VS Code automatically provides context to the chat prompt based on your current activity. The following information is implicitly included in the chat context:

*   The currently selected text in the active editor.
*   The file name or notebook name of the active editor.

The actual contents of the active file are not included in the context, but are shown as a suggested context item in the chat input box (indicated with italic text and a dotted outline). Depending on your prompt, VS Code might decide to read the contents of the active file. To explicitly include the contents of the active file in the chat context, select the suggested file in the chat input box.

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing the active file as a suggested context item in the chat input box.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-context-current-file.png)

## #-mentions

In chat, you can explicitly refer to context by typing `#` followed by the context item you want to mention. This enables the AI to provide more relevant responses based on the specific context you are referring to.

Type the `#` symbol in the chat input field to see a list of available context items.

![Screenshot of VS Code Chat view, showing the chat variable picker.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view-chat-variables.png)

To reference a specific workspace file, folder, or code symbol, type `#` followed by the file name, folder name, or symbol name. Learn more about [referencing files and folders in chat](#_add-files-as-context).

Alternatively, choose from the list of available predefined context items like `#changes` to get the diffs of changed files, or `#codebase` to perform a codebase search for your workspace.

Make sure to enable the [github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled) _(preview)_ setting to get the best results.

Supported context items

VS Code supports the following context items:

Context item

Description

#changes

Get the diffs of changed files in source control.

#codebase

Perform a codebase search across the current workspace.

#extensions

Search across VS Code extensions.

#fetch

Get the contents of a web page.

#githubRepo

Perform a web search within a GitHub repo.

#problems

Get the list of problems for the current workspace.

#selection

Get the text selection for the active editor.

#searchResults

Get the results from the Search view.

#terminalSelection

Get the terminal text selection.

#testFailure

Get the list of test failures.

#usages

Get symbol references across the workspace.

#vscodeAPI

Perform a search across the VS Code extension API.

### Prompt examples

The following examples show how to use #-mentions in your chat prompts:

Reference your pending source control changes

*   `"Summarize the #changes"`
*   `"Generate release notes based on the #changes"`

Understand the codebase

*   `"Explain how authentication works in #codebase"`
*   `"Where is the database connecting string configured? #codebase"`
*   `"How do I build this #codebase?"`
*   `"Where is #getUser used? #usages"`

Generate code that is consistent with your codebase

*   `"Create an about page and include it in the nav bar #codebase"`
*   `"Add a new API route for updating the address info #codebase"`
*   `"Add a login button and style it based on #styles.css"`

Fix issues in the workspace

*   `"Fix the issues in #problems"`
*   `"Fix the failing tests #testFailure"`

Get information about extensions

*   `"What are the top #extensions for this workspace?"`

Reference content from the web

*   `"How do I use the 'useState' hook in react 18? #fetch https://18.react.dev/reference/react/useState#usage"`
*   `"Build an API endpoint to fetch address info, use the template from #githubRepo contoso/api-templates"`

## Add files as context

To let the AI automatically find relevant files and symbols in your workspace, you can use `#codebase`. To provide specific files, folders, or symbols as context, add them to the chat using the following methods:

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing a prompt that references a file from the workspace.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-reference-file.png)

*   #-mention the file, folder, or symbol in your chat message by typing `#` followed by the name of the file, folder, or symbol. To reference a symbol, make sure to open the file containing the symbol in the editor first.
    
*   Drag and drop files or folders from the Explorer view, Search view, or editor tabs onto the Chat view to add them as context.
    
*   Use the **Add Context** button in the Chat view and select **Files & Folders** or **Symbols**.

Note

If possible, the full contents of the file will be included when you attach a file. If that is too large to fit into the context window, an outline of the file will be included that includes functions and their descriptions without implementations. If the outline is also too large, then the file won't be part of the prompt.

## Perform a codebase search

Instead of adding individual files manually, you can let VS Code find the right files from your codebase automatically. This can be useful when you don't know which files are relevant to your question.

Add `#codebase` in your prompt or select **Add Context** > **Tools** > **codebase** to enable code search for your workspace.

The following prompt examples show how to use codebase search:

*   `"Explain how authentication works in #codebase"`
*   `"Where is the database connecting string configured? #codebase"`
*   `"Add a new API route for updating the address #codebase"`

Make sure to enable the [github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled) _(preview)_ setting to get the best results.

## Reference web content

You can reference content from the web in your chat prompts, for example to get the latest API reference or code examples.

*   `#fetch`: use this tool to retrieve content from a specific web page, such as a version-specific documentation page of a framework. To use this tool, type `#fetch` followed by the URL of the page you want to reference.
    
    *   `"What are the highlights of VS Code 1.100 #fetch https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_100"`
    *   `"Update the asp.net app to .net 9 #fetch https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/80-90"`
*   `#githubRepo`: use this tool to perform a code search within a GitHub repository, for example to reference code patterns or examples from another project. Type `#githubRepo` followed by the repository name (for example, `microsoft/vscode-docs`).
    
    *   `"How does routing work in next.js #githubRepo vercel/next.js"`
    *   `"Perform a code review to validate it's consistent with #githubRepo microsoft/typescript"`
    *   `"Add unit tests for my app. Use the same test setup and structure as #githubRepo rust-lang/rust"`

## Reference tools

Chat in VS Code has several [built-in tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_agent-mode-tools) and you can further extend it with tools from [MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) or extensions. For example, the `#fetch` tool is a built-in tool that allows you to fetch content from a web page. You can also group tools into [tool sets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_define-tool-sets), which you can then reference in your chat prompts.

To reference a tool or tool set directly in your chat prompt, type `#` followed by the tool (set) name and optional tool parameters. The following prompt examples show how to use tools:

*   Use the [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) tool (configured as `github-mcp` in your `mcp.json`):
    
    *   `"what are my open issues #github-mcp"`
    *   `"Implement a fix for issue #123 in contoso/tailwindtraders #github-mcp"`
    *   `"What is PR 8407 in microsoft/vscode-docs about? #github-mcp"`
*   Use the `#postgres` MCP server to query a PostgreSQL database:
    
    *   `"Generate an API endpoint and data access layer for getting weather data from #postgres"`
    *   `"What is the max length of the company name from #postgres"`

## @-mentions

When you use [ask mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode) in chat, you can use the `@` symbol to pass the chat prompt to a chat participant. A chat participant is a domain expert that has context and knowledge about a specific topic. For example, the built-in `@vscode` participant is an expert on VS Code and the extension API, or `@terminal` can help with shell commands.

To use a chat participant, start your prompt with `@` followed by the participant name, and then continue with your question.

The following examples show how to use @-mentions in your chat prompts:

*   `"@vscode how to enable word wrapping"`
*   `"@terminal what are the top 5 largest files in the current directory"`

Type `@` in the chat input field to see a list of available chat participants.

Extensions can also contribute their own [chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat).

## Add elements from the VS Code simple browser (Experimental)

VS Code has a built-in simple browser that you can use to view and interact with a locally-hosted web application, for example to do quick testing and debugging of your web application.

You can add elements from the Simple Browser window as context to your chat prompt. To do this:

1.  Make sure to enable selecting elements from the Simple Browser with the [chat.sendElementsToChat.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.sendElementsToChat.enabled) setting.
    
2.  Run your web application locally.
    
3.  Open the Simple Browser view by running the **Simple Browser: Show** command from the Command Palette.
    
4.  Select the **Start** button to start selecting elements from the current page.
    
5.  Hover over the elements of the web page and click to add them to the chat prompt.
    
    Notice that the selected element is added as context to the current chat prompt.

You can configure which information is included in the context:

*   Attach CSS - enable with the [chat.sendElementsToChat.attachCSS](vscode://settings/chat.sendElementsToChat.attachCSS) setting.
*   Attach images - enable with the [chat.sendElementsToChat.attachImages](vscode://settings/chat.sendElementsToChat.attachImages) setting.

Tip

This functionality is also available in the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension (pre-release).

## Chat history

Chat in VS Code is designed to be a multi-turn conversation. Within a chat session, VS Code uses the history of the conversation as context to your current prompt. This means that you can ask follow-up questions or clarify your previous question without having to repeat the context.

To start over with a new chat session and discard the current context, select the **New Chat** (`+`) button (⌃L (Windows, Linux Ctrl+L)) in the Chat view. This can be useful if you want to move to a different topic and avoid the previous context and history.

Learn more about [chat history and context management](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat#_chat-history).

## Custom instructions

With instruction files, you can provide the AI with common guidelines and rules for generating responses that match your coding style and preferences. Instruction files are Markdown files that you can create in your workspace or in your current profile.

By using instruction files, you can avoid having to repeatedly add common instructions in your chat prompts, and instead have the AI automatically apply these instructions to your chat interactions.

Learn more about [using instruction files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization).

## Workspace indexing

VS Code uses an index to quickly and accurately search your codebase for relevant code snippets. This index can either be maintained by GitHub or stored locally on your machine.

The following workspace indexing options are available:

*   **Remote index**: if your code is hosted in a GitHub repository, you can build a remote index search your codebase quickly, even for large codebases.
*   **Local index**: use an advanced semantic index that is stored on your local machine to provide fast and accurate search results for your codebase.
*   **Basic index**: if local indexing is not available, you can use simpler algorithms that are optimized to work locally for larger codebases.

Learn more about [workspace indexing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context#_managing-the-workspace-index).

*   Learn about [tools in agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_agent-mode-tools).

# Chat modes in VS Code

In this article

Chat modes are predefined configurations that enable you to tailor the AI chat behavior in Visual Studio Code for specific tasks, such as asking questions, making code edits, or performing autonomous coding tasks. Switch between chat modes at any time in the Chat view, depending on the task you want to accomplish.

VS Code comes with three [built-in chat modes](#_built-in-chat-modes): **Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**. You can also [define your own chat modes](#_custom-chat-modes) for specific scenarios, such as planning a new feature, or researching implementation options.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Switch between chat modes

To switch between chat modes, open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)), and then select the desired mode from the chat mode dropdown list.

![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting the chat mode dropdown list.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes/chat-mode-dropdown.png)

## Built-in chat modes

Chat in VS Code can operate in different modes, each optimized for a specific use case. You can change between the different chat modes at any time in the Chat view.

Chat mode

Description

[Ask mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode)

Ask mode is optimized for answering questions about your codebase, coding, and general technology concepts.  
Use ask mode to understand how a piece of code works, brainstorm software design ideas, or explore new technologies.  
Open ask mode in [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask) | [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask).

[Edit mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits)

Edit mode is optimized for making code edits across multiple files in your project. VS Code directly applies the code changes in the editor, where you can review them in-place.  
Use edit mode for coding tasks when you have a good understanding of the changes that you want to make, and which files you want to edit.  
Open edit mode in [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=edit) | [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=edit).

[Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)

Agent mode is optimized for making autonomous edits across multiple files in your project.  
Use agent mode for coding tasks when you have a less well-defined task that might also require running terminal commands and tools.  
Open agent mode in [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent) | [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent).

## Custom chat modes

Note

Custom chat modes are available as of VS Code release 1.101 and are currently in preview.

The built-in chat modes provide general-purpose configurations for chat in VS Code. For a more tailored chat experience, you can create your own chat modes.

Custom chat modes consist of a set of instructions and tools that are applied when you switch to that mode. For example, a "Plan" chat mode could include instructions for generating an implementation plan and only use read-only tools. By creating a custom chat mode, you can quickly switch to that specific configuration without having to manually select relevant tools and instructions each time.

Custom chat modes are defined in a `.chatmode.md` Markdown file, and can be stored in your workspace for others to use, or in your user profile, where you can reuse them across different workspaces.

You can reference instructions files and tools (sets) in your custom chat mode file.

### Chat mode file structure

A chat mode file is a Markdown file with the `.chatmode.md` suffix. It has the following two main sections:

*   Front Matter metadata header
    
    *   `description`: A brief description of the chat mode. This description is displayed when you hover the chat mode in the chat mode dropdown list in the Chat view.
    *   `tools`: A list of tool or tool set names that are available for this chat mode. This can include built-in tools, tool sets, MCP tools, or tools contributed by extensions. Use the **Configure Tools** action to select the tools from the list of available tools in your workspace.
*   Body with chat mode instructions
    
    This is where you provide specific prompts, guidelines, or any other relevant information that you want the AI to follow when in this chat mode. You can also reference instructions files by using Markdown links. The chat mode instructions will complement whatever is specified in the chat prompt.

### Chat mode file example

The following code snippet shows an example of a "Plan" chat mode file that generates an implementation plan and doesn't make any code edits.

```
---
description: Generate an implementation plan for new features or refactoring existing code.
tools: ['codebase', 'fetch', 'findTestFiles', 'githubRepo', 'search', 'usages']
---
# Planning mode instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.
```

### Create a chat mode

You can create a chat mode file in your workspace or user profile.

1.  Run the **Chat: New Mode File** command in the Command Palette ().
    
2.  Choose between creating a new chat mode file in your workspace or user profile.
    
3.  Enter a name for the chat mode. This name is used in the chat mode dropdown list in the Chat view.
    
4.  Provide the details for the chat mode in the newly created `.chatmode.md` file.
    
    *   Provide the description and configure the list of available tools or tool sets in the Front Matter metadata.
    *   Add instructions for the chat mode in the body of the file.

By default, VS Code looks for workspace chat mode files in the `.github/chatmodes` folder. You can configure the locations of workspace chat mode files with the [chat.modeFilesLocations](vscode://settings/chat.modeFilesLocations) setting.

### Manage existing chat modes

To edit and manage existing chat modes, select the **Chat: Configure Chat Modes** command in the Command Palette (). Select a chat mode from the list to open it in the editor, where you can edit the instructions and tools (sets).

Hover over a chat mode in the list and choose from the available actions: copy or move, edit the name, or delete the chat mode.

# Use ask mode in VS Code

In this article

Chat in Visual Studio Code lets you use natural language to interact with large language models (LLMs) to get help with your code. _Ask mode_ for chat is optimized for asking questions about your codebase, coding, and general technology concepts. Ask mode is particularly useful for getting a better understanding of your codebase, brainstorming ideas, and getting help with coding tasks.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Why use ask mode?

Ask mode is optimized for answering questions about your codebase, coding, and general technology concepts. You can use it to:

*   Ask questions about your codebase, such as "Where is the database connection string defined?" or "Explain the sort function".
*   Brainstorm ideas, such as "How can I improve the performance of my application?" or "Provide 3 different ways to implement a search feature".
*   Get help with coding tasks, such as "How do I create a new React component?" or "How do I implement the factory pattern?".

In ask mode, the response can contain code blocks, which you can [apply to your codebase](#_apply-a-code-block-from-chat). This works well for smaller edits within a single file. However, [edit mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits) and [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) are better suited for making larger changes across multiple files or for more complex coding tasks.

## Use ask mode

Follow these steps to get started with ask mode in VS Code:

1.  Open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)) and select **Ask** from the chat mode selector.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the Chat view, showing the mode dropdown with "Ask" selected.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/ask-mode/chat-mode-dropdown-ask.png)
    
    Directly open ask mode in VS Code [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask) or [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask).
    
2.  Type your question in the chat input field and select **Send** (Enter) to submit it.
    
    Experiment with some of these example questions to get started:
    
    *   `"What is the factory design pattern?"`
    *   `"How do I use the fetch API in JavaScript?"`
    *   `"How do I create a new React component?"`
3.  Add context to your chat prompt by using **Add Context** or #-mentioning specific workspace files or predefined context items like `#codebase`.
    
    By adding context, you can get more relevant responses. For example, to ask questions that are specific to your current project, you can use the `#codebase` context item. Type `#` in the chat input field to view the list of available context items.
    
    Here are some example prompts that use context:
    
    *   `"Where is the db connecting string defined in #codebase?"`
    *   `"Which testing framework is used for #calculator.test.js?"`
    *   `"Summarize the changes in #changes"`
    
    Learn more about [adding context to your chat prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context).
    
4.  Notice that, based on your question, the response might include different types of rich content, such as code blocks, terminal commands, links, and references to symbols in your code.
    
    Learn how you can [apply code blocks](#_apply-a-code-block-from-chat) to your codebase, or run terminal commands directly in the integrated terminal.

## Apply a code block from chat

When your chat response contains code blocks, you can apply them individually to the corresponding file in your workspace. VS Code performs a smart apply and inserts the changes in the right location within the file.

To apply a code block to your codebase, hover over the code block and select the **Apply in Editor** button. VS Code tries to apply the proposed changes to your existing code.

![Screenshot of a chat code block response, highlighting the actions to apply changes.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/ask-mode/copilot-chat-view-code-block-actions.png)

Alternatively, you can also copy the code or insert it at the current cursor position. Hover over the code block and select the corresponding action.

Depending on the language extension, code blocks in chat responses might support IntelliSense, similar to the experience in the editor.

If a code block contains a shell command, you can run it directly in the integrated terminal with the **Insert into Terminal** (⌃⌥Enter (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+Enter)) action.

![Chat code block to list files with Insert into Terminal option visible](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/ask-mode/run-in-terminal.png)

Tip

Navigate between code blocks with the **Chat: Next Code Block** (⌥⌘PageDown (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+PageDown)) and **Chat Previous Code Block** (⌥⌘PageUp (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+PageUp)) commands.

## Quick chat

Use Quick Chat to ask a quick question without starting a full chat session on the side. Quick Chat is a lightweight chat experience that lets you open a Quick Pick to ask a question.

To open Quick Chat, select **Quick Chat** from the Copilot menu in the title bar, or use the ⇧⌥⌘L (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L) keyboard shortcut.

You can ask a question in Quick Chat, and if you want to keep the conversation going, promote it to a full chat session with the **Open in Chat View** button.

## Special keywords

In your prompt, you can use special keywords to get more relevant responses:

*   #-mentions: used to add context to your chat prompt. For example, `#codebase` to refer to the entire codebase, or `#<file | folder | symbol>` to refer to a specific file, folder, or symbol in your workspace. Type `#` in the chat input field to view the list of context items. Learn more about [adding context to your chat prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context).
    
*   @-mentions: used to reference a _chat participant_, which can help answer questions about a specific topic like interacting with a database. Type `@` in the chat input field to view the list of available participants. Choose from built-in participants like `@terminal`, or [extension-provided participants](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Achat-participant&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance).
    
*   _Slash commands_: provide a shortcut to commonly used instructions, such as `/fix` to propose a fix for a problem, or `/explain` to explain how the selected code works. Type `/` in the chat input field to view a list of available slash commands.

*   [Learn more about using chat in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)
*   [Add context to your chat prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context)
*   [Use edit mode to make code edits across multiple files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits)
*   [Use agent mode to start an autonomous coding session](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)

# Use edit mode in VS Code

In this article

With chat _edit mode_ in Visual Studio Code, you can use natural language to make edits across multiple files in your project. The edits are applied directly in the editor, where you can review them in-place, with the full context of the surrounding code.

By selecting specific files and providing clear context, you can guide edit mode to make targeted code changes and improvements.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Why use edit mode?

Edit mode is optimized for making code edits across multiple files in your project. VS Code directly applies the code changes in the editor, where you can review them in-place. You can use edit mode to:

*   Refactor parts of your codebase, such as "refactor this using async/await" or "use a singleton pattern for the database connection".
*   Add new features to your codebase, such as "add a login form to the app".
*   Fix bugs in your codebase, such as "the sort function fails when the input is empty, fix it".
*   Write unit tests for your code, such as "add unit tests for the calculator class using vitest".
*   Improve the performance of your code, such as "optimize the calculate function to make it more efficient".

Edit mode is particularly useful for coding tasks when you have a good understanding of the changes that you want to make, and which files you want to edit. If you have a less well-defined task, a high-level requirement, or changes that also require running terminal commands and tools, you might want to use [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) instead.

## Use edit mode

In edit mode, you select which files to edit and provide the relevant context and prompt. VS Code will suggest code edits based on your prompt.

1.  Open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)) and select **Edit** from the chat mode selector.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting edit mode selected.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/chat-mode-dropdown-edit.png)
    
    Directly open edit mode in VS Code [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=edit) or [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=edit).
    
2.  Select **Add Context** or #-mention specific workspace files or context items to provide extra context for your prompt.
    
    By adding context, you can get more relevant responses. For example, to ask questions that are specific to your current project, you can use the `#codebase` context item. Type `#` in the chat input field to view the list of available context items.
    
    The active editor is automatically added as context. When you add files, other relevant files might be suggested.
    
3.  Enter your prompt in the chat input field to indicate the type of edits you want to make.
    
    Experiment with some of these example questions to get started:
    
    *   `Refactor the calculate function to make it more efficient.`
    *   `Add a login form to the app. Use OAuth for authentication.`
    *   `Add unit tests for the calculator class. Use vitest as the test framework.`
4.  Notice that VS Code streams the suggested edits directly in the editor.
    
    The Chat view shows the list of files that were edited in bold text. The editor overlay controls enable you to navigate between the suggested edits.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the Chat view, highlighting the changed files list and the indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-changed-files.png)
    
5.  Review the suggested edits and [accept or discard the suggested edits](#_accept-or-discard-edits).
    
6.  Continue to iterate on the code changes to refine the edits or to implement additional features.

## Accept or discard edits

VS Code lists the files that were edited in the changed files list in the Chat view. Files with pending edits also have an indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs.

![Screenshot that shows the Chat view, highlighting the changed files list and the indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-changed-files-full.png)

With the editor overlay controls, you can navigate between the suggested edits by using the Up () and Down () controls. Use the **Keep** or **Undo** button to accept or reject the edits for a given file.

![Screenshot showing the Editor with proposed changes, highlighting the review controls in the editor overlay controls.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-file-review-controls.png)

Use the **Keep** or **Undo** controls in the editor or Chat view to accept or reject individual or all suggested edits.

![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting the Accept All and Discard All buttons.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-accept-discard.png)

With the [chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay](vscode://settings/chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay) setting, you can configure a delay after which the suggested edits are automatically accepted. Hover over the editor overlay controls to cancel the auto-accept countdown.

When you close VS Code, the status of the pending edits is remembered. When you reopen VS Code, the pending edits are restored and you can still accept or discard the edits.

## Revert edits

As you're sending requests to make edits to your code, you might want to roll back some of these changes, for example because you want to use another implementation strategy or because the AI starts walking down the wrong path when generating edits.

You can use the **Undo Last Edit** control in the Chat view title bar to revert the last edits and return to the state before sending the last request. After you perform an undo of the last edit, you can redo those edits again by using the **Redo Last Edit** control in the Chat view title bar.

![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting the Undo and Redo actions in the view title bar.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-undo-redo.png)

You can also use the **Undo Edits (Delete)** control (x icon) when hovering over a request in the Chat view to revert all edits that were made from that request onwards.

![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting the Undo Edits control for a specific request.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-undo-request.png)

## Use instructions to get AI edits that follow your coding style

To get AI-generated code edits that follow your coding style, preferred frameworks, and other preferences, you can use instruction files. Instruction files enable you to describe your coding style and preferences in Markdown files, which the AI uses to generate code edits that match your requirements.

You can manually attach instruction files as context to your chat prompt, or you can configure the instruction files to be automatically applied.

The following code snippet shows an example of an instruction file that describes your coding style and preferences:

```
---
applyTo: "**"
---
# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
```

Learn more about [using instruction files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization).

## Settings

The following list contains the settings related to edit mode. You can configure settings through the Setting editor (⌘, (Windows, Linux Ctrl+,)).

*   [chat.editing.confirmEditRequestRemoval](vscode://settings/chat.editing.confirmEditRequestRemoval) - ask for confirmation before undoing an edit (default: `true`).
*   [chat.editing.confirmEditRequestRetry](vscode://settings/chat.editing.confirmEditRequestRetry) - ask for confirmation before performing a redo of the last edit (default: `true`).
*   [chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay](vscode://settings/chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay) - configure a delay after which suggested edits are automatically accepted, use zero to disable auto-accept (default: 0).
*   [github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled) _(preview)_ - let VS Code find the right files when you add `#codebase` to your prompt, similar to how agent mode works (default: `false`).

## Frequently asked questions

### Why would I use edit mode instead of agent mode?

Consider the following criteria to choose between edit mode and agent mode:

*   **Edit scope**: you might use edit mode if your request involves only code edits and you know the precise scope for the changes.
*   **Duration**: agent mode involves multiple steps to process a request, so it might take longer to get a response. For example, to determine the relevant context and files to edit, determine the plan of action, and more.
*   **Non-deterministic**: agent mode evaluates the outcome of the generated edits and might iterate multiple times. As a result, agent mode can be more non-deterministic than edit mode.
*   **Request quota**: in agent mode, depending on the complexity of the task, one prompt might result in many requests to the backend.

# Use agent mode in VS Code

In this article

With chat _agent mode_ in Visual Studio Code, you can use natural language to specify a high-level task, and let AI autonomously reason about the request, plan the work needed, and apply the changes to your codebase. Agent mode uses a combination of code editing and tool invocation to accomplish the task you specified. As it processes your request, it monitors the outcome of edits and tools, and iterates to resolve any issues that arise.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Why use agent mode?

Agent mode is optimized for making autonomous edits across multiple files in your project. It is particularly useful for complex tasks that require not only code edits but also the invocation of tools and terminal commands. You can use agent mode to:

*   Refactor parts of your codebase, such as "refactor the app to use a Redis cache".
*   Plan and implement new features, such as "add a login form to the app using OAuth for authentication".
*   Migrate your codebase to a new framework, such as "migrate the app from React to Vue.js".
*   Generate an implementation plan for a complex task, such as "create a meal-planning web app using a Swift front-end and a Node.js back-end".
*   Define a high-level requirement, such as "add social media sharing functionality".

Agent mode is particularly useful for coding tasks when you have a less well-defined task that might also require running terminal commands and tools. Agent mode autonomously determines the relevant context and tasks to accomplish the request. It can also iterate multiple times to resolve intermediate issues, such as syntax errors or test failures.

## Enable agent mode in VS Code

Note

Agent mode is available starting from VS Code 1.99.

To enable agent mode in VS Code, enable the [chat.agent.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.agent.enabled) setting.

To centrally enable or disable agent mode within your organization, check [Centrally Manage VS Code Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_centrally-manage-vs-code-settings) in the enterprise documentation.

## Use agent mode

In agent mode, the AI operates autonomously and determines the relevant context for your prompt.

Follow these steps to get started:

1.  Open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)) and select **Agent** from the chat mode selector.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting agent mode selected.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-agent-mode.png)
    
    Directly open agent mode in VS Code [Stable](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent) or [Insiders](vscode-insiders://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent).
    
2.  Enter your prompt for making edits in the chat input field and select **Send** (Enter) to submit it.
    
    You can specify a high-level requirement, and you don't have to specify which files to work on. In agent mode, the AI determines the relevant context and files to edit autonomously.
    
    Experiment with some of these example prompts to get started:
    
    *   `Create a meal-planning web app using React and Node.js`
    *   `Add social media sharing functionality`
    *   `Replace current auth with OAuth`
3.  Agent mode might invoke multiple [tools](#_agent-mode-tools) to accomplish different tasks. Optionally, select the **Tools** icon to configure which tools can be used for responding to your request.
    
    ![Screenshot showing the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the Tools icon in the chat input.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/agent-mode-select-tools.png)
    
    Tip
    
    You can also directly reference a tool in your prompt by typing `#` followed by the tool name. You can do this in all chat modes (ask, edit, and agent mode).
    
4.  Confirm tool invocations and terminal commands.
    
    Before running a terminal command or non-builtin tool, Copilot requests confirmation to continue. This is because tools might run locally on your machine and perform actions that modify files or data.
    
    Use the **Continue** button dropdown options to automatically confirm the specific tool for the current session, workspace, or all future invocations. Learn how to [manage tool approvals and approve all tool invocations](#_manage-tool-approvals).
    
    ![MCP Tool Confirmation](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-tool-confirmation.png)
    
    If your project has configured [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks) in `tasks.json`, agent mode tries to run the appropriate tasks. For example, if you've defined a build task, agent mode will run the build task before running the application. Enable or disable running workspace tasks with the [github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks) setting.
    
5.  Optionally, verify and edit the tool input parameters before running the tool.
    
    Select the chevron next to the tool name to view its details and input parameters. You can edit the input parameters before running the tool.
    
    ![MCP Tool Input Parameters](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-tool-edit-parameters.png)
    
6.  Copilot detects issues and problems in code edits and terminal commands and will iterate and perform additional actions to resolve them.
    
    Enable the [github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix) setting to automatically diagnose and fix issues in the generated code changes. This setting is enabled by default.
    
    For example, agent mode might run unit tests as a result of a code edit. If the tests fail, it uses the test outcome to resolve the issue.
    
    Copilot Edits agent mode iterates multiple times to resolve issues and problems. The [chat.agent.maxRequests](vscode://settings/chat.agent.maxRequests) setting controls the maximum number of requests that Copilot Edits can make in agent mode.
    
7.  As Copilot processes your request, notice that Copilot streams the suggested code edits directly in the editor.
    
    The Chat view shows the list of files that were edited in bold text. The editor overlay controls enable you to navigate between the suggested edits.
    
8.  Review the suggested edits and [accept or discard the suggested edits](#_accept-or-discard-edits).
    
9.  Continue to iterate on the code changes to refine the edits or implement additional features.

## Agent mode tools

Agent mode uses tools to accomplish specialized tasks while processing a user request. Examples of such tasks are listing the files in a directory, editing a file in your workspace, running a terminal command, getting the output from the terminal, and more.

Agent mode can use the following tools:

*   Built-in tools
*   [MCP tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers)
*   [Tools contributed by extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tools)

You can view and manage the tools that can be used for responding to a request. Select the **Tools** icon in the Chat view to view and manage the tools that are available in agent mode.

![Screenshot showing the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the Tools icon in the chat input.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/agent-mode-select-tools.png)

Based on the outcome of a tool, Copilot might invoke other tools to accomplish the overall request. For example, if a code edit results in syntax errors in the file, Copilot might explore another approach and suggest different code changes.

You can enable or disable the use of agent tools by configuring the [chat.extensionTools.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.extensionTools.enabled) setting. Learn how to centrally manage this setting in your organization by checking [Centrally Manage VS Code Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_centrally-manage-vs-code-settings) in the enterprise documentation.

### Define tool sets

A tool set is a collection of tools that you can use in chat. You can use tool sets in the same way as you would use individual tools. For example, select a tool set with the tools picker in agent mode or reference the tool set directly in your prompt by typing `#` followed by the tool set name.

![Screenshot showing the tools picker, highlighting user-defined tool sets.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/agent-mode/tools-picker-tool-sets.png)

Tool sets enable you to group related tools together, making it easier to use them in your chat prompts, [prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization), or [custom chat modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes). This can be particularly useful when you have many installed tools from MCP servers or extensions.

To create a tool set, use the **Chat: Configure Tool Sets** > **Create new tool sets file** command in the Command Palette. A tool sets file is a `.jsonc` file that is stored in your user profile.

A tool set has the following structure:

*   `<tool set name>`: name of the tool set, which is displayed in the tools picker and when referencing the tool set in your prompt.
*   `tools`: list of tool names that are included in the tool set. The tools can be built-in tools, MCP tools, or tools contributed by extensions.
*   `description`: brief description of the tool set. This description is displayed alongside the tool set name in the tools picker.
*   `icon`: icon for the tool set, values can be found in the [Product Icon Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels).

The following code snippet shows an example of a tool sets file:

```
{
  "reader": {
    "tools": [
      "changes",
      "codebase",
      "fetch",
      "findTestFiles",
      "githubRepo",
      "problems",
      "usages"
    ],
    "description": "description",
    "icon": "tag"
  }
}
```

## Manage tool approvals

When a tool is invoked, Copilot requests confirmation to run the tool. This is because tools might run locally on your machine and perform actions that modify files or data.

In the Chat view, after a tool invocation, use the **Continue** button dropdown options to automatically confirm the specific tool for the current session, workspace, or all future invocations.

![MCP Tool Confirmation](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-tool-confirmation.png)

You can reset the tool confirmations by using the **Chat: Reset Tool Confirmations** command in the Command Palette.

In case you want to auto-approve _all_ tools, you can now use the experimental [chat.tools.autoApprove](vscode://settings/chat.tools.autoApprove) setting. This will automatically approve all tool invocations, and VS Code will not ask for confirmation when a language model wishes to run tools. Bear in mind that with this setting enabled, you will not have the opportunity to cancel potentially destructive actions a model wants to take.

As an enhanced boundary, you might choose to set [chat.tools.autoApprove](vscode://settings/chat.tools.autoApprove) only when connected to a [remote environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). You'll want to set this as a remote, rather than user-level, setting. Note that remote environments that are part of your local machine (like dev containers) or that have access to your credentials will still pose different levels of risk.

Learn how to centrally manage the auto-approve tools setting in your organization by checking [Centrally Manage VS Code Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_centrally-manage-vs-code-settings) in the enterprise documentation.

## Accept or discard edits

Copilot lists the files that were edited in the list of the changed files in the Chat view. Files with pending edits also have an indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs.

![Screenshot that shows the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the changed files list and the indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-changed-files-full.png)

With the editor overlay controls, you can navigate between the suggested edits by using the Up () and Down () controls. Use the **Keep** or **Undo** button to accept or reject the edits for a given file.

![Screenshot showing the Editor with proposed changes, highlighting the review controls in the editor overlay controls.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-file-review-controls.png)

Use the **Keep** or **Undo** controls in the editor or Chat view to accept or reject individual or all suggested edits.

![Screenshot showing the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the Accept All and Discard All buttons.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-accept-discard.png)

With the [chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay](vscode://settings/chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay) setting, you can configure a delay after which the suggested edits are automatically accepted. Hover over the editor overlay controls to cancel the auto-accept countdown.

When you close VS Code, the status of the pending edits is remembered. When you reopen VS Code, the pending edits are restored, and you can still accept or discard the edits.

## Revert edits

As you're sending requests to make edits to your code, you might want to roll back some of these changes, for example, because you want to use another implementation strategy or because Copilot starts walking down the wrong path when generating edits.

You can use the **Undo Last Edit** control in the Chat view title bar to revert the last edits and return to the state before sending the last request. After you perform an undo of the last edit, you can redo those edits again by using the **Redo Last Edit** control in the Chat view title bar.

![Screenshot showing the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the Undo and Redo actions in the view title bar.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-undo-redo.png)

You can also use the **Undo Edits (Delete)** control (x icon) when hovering over a request in the Copilot Edits view to revert all edits that were made from that request onwards.

![Screenshot showing the Copilot Edits view, highlighting the Undo Edits control for a specific request.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits/copilot-edits-undo-request.png)

## Interrupt an agent mode request

To interrupt an ongoing request, you can either **Pause** it or **Cancel** it. When you pause a request, Copilot stops processing the request and waits for your input.

When you pause a request, you can either choose to enter a new prompt, which cancels the current request, or you can choose to resume the current request.

When you cancel a request, Copilot interrupts and ends the active request. You can still [review and accept or reject](#_accept-or-discard-edits) the changes that were made up to that point.

## Use instructions to get AI edits that follow your coding style

To get AI-generated code edits that follow your coding style, preferred frameworks, and other preferences, you can use instruction files. Instruction files enable you to describe your coding style and preferences in Markdown files, which the AI uses to generate code edits that match your requirements.

You can manually attach instruction files as context to your chat prompt, or you can configure the instruction files to be automatically applied.

The following code snippet shows an example of an instruction file that describes your coding style and preferences:

```
---
applyTo: "**"
---
# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
```

Learn more about [using instruction files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization).

## Settings

The following list contains the settings related to agent mode. You can configure settings through the Settings editor (⌘, (Windows, Linux Ctrl+,)).

*   [chat.agent.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.agent.enabled): enable or disable agent mode (default: `false`, requires VS Code 1.99 or later)
*   [chat.agent.maxRequests](vscode://settings/chat.agent.maxRequests): maximum number of requests that Copilot Edits can make in agent mode (default: 5 for Copilot Free users, 15 for other users)
*   [github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks): run workspace tasks when using agent mode in Copilot Edits (default: `true`)
*   [chat.mcp.discovery.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.discovery.enabled): enable or disable discovery of MCP servers configured in other tools (default: `true`)
*   [github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix): automatically diagnose and fix issues in the generated code changes (default: `true`)
*   [chat.tools.autoApprove](vscode://settings/chat.tools.autoApprove) _(Experimental)_: automatically approve all tools (default: `false`)

## Frequently asked questions

### Why would I use agent mode instead of edit mode?

Consider the following criteria to choose between edit mode and agent mode:

*   **Edit scope**: agent mode autonomously determines the relevant context and files to edit. In edit mode, you need to specify the context yourself.
*   **Task complexity**: agent mode is better suited for complex tasks that require not only code edits but also the invocation of tools and terminal commands.
*   **Duration**: agent mode involves multiple steps to process a request, so it might take longer to get a response. For example, to determine the relevant context and files to edit, determine the plan of action, and more.
*   **Self-healing**: agent mode evaluates the outcome of the generated edits and might iterate multiple times to resolve intermediate issues.
*   **Request quota**: in agent mode, depending on the complexity of the task, one prompt might result in many requests to the backend.

# Use MCP servers in VS Code (Preview)

In this article

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable you to expand your chat experience in VS Code with extra tools for connecting to databases, invoking APIs, or performing specialized tasks. Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools and services through a unified interface. This article guides you through setting up MCP servers and using tools with agent mode in Visual Studio Code.

Note

MCP support in VS Code is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with external tools, applications, and data sources. When you enter a chat prompt to a language model with agent mode in VS Code, the model can invoke various tools to perform tasks like file operations, accessing databases, or calling APIs in response to your request.

How does MCP work?

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

*   **MCP clients** (like VS Code) connect to MCP servers and request actions on behalf of the AI model
*   **MCP servers** provide one or more tools that expose specific functionalities through a well-defined interface
*   **The Model Context Protocol (MCP)** defines the message format for communication between clients and servers, including tool discovery, invocation, and response handling

For example, a file system MCP server might provide tools for reading, writing, or searching files and directories. GitHub's MCP server offers tools to list repositories, create pull requests, or manage issues. MCP servers can run locally on your machine or be hosted remotely, and VS Code supports both configurations.

By standardizing this interaction, MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations between each AI model and each tool. This allows you to extend your AI assistant's capabilities by simply adding new MCP servers to your workspace. Learn more about the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Supported MCP capabilities in VS Code

VS Code supports the following MCP capabilities:

*   MCP Server transport: local standard input/output (`stdio`), server-sent events (`sse`), and streamable HTTP (`http`) for MCP server transport.
*   [MCP features](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#features): tools, prompts, resources, and sampling.
*   VS Code provides servers with the current workspace folders using `roots` ([spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots)).

Finding MCP servers

The [curated list of MCP servers](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp) on the VS Code website is a great starting point. Choose from different categories and directly install MCP servers in VS Code.

MCP's [official server repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) provides official, and community-contributed servers that showcase MCP's versatility. You can explore servers for various functionalities, such as file system operations, database interactions, and web services.

MCP is still a relatively new standard, and the ecosystem is rapidly evolving. As more developers adopt MCP, you can expect to see an increasing number of servers and tools available for integration with your projects.

## Enable MCP support in VS Code

Note

MCP support in agent mode in VS Code is available starting from VS Code 1.99 and is currently in preview.

To enable MCP support in VS Code, enable the [chat.mcp.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.enabled) setting.

To centrally enable or disable MCP support within your organization, check [Centrally Manage VS Code Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_centrally-manage-vs-code-settings) in the enterprise documentation.

## Add an MCP server

You have multiple options to add an MCP server in VS Code:

*   **Workspace settings**: add a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace to configure MCP servers for a workspace and share configurations with team members.
*   **User settings**: specify the server in your user settings to enable the MCP server across all workspaces.
*   **Automatic discovery**: enable autodiscovery of MCP servers defined in other tools, such as Claude Desktop.

Caution

MCP servers can run arbitrary code on your machine. Only add servers from trusted sources, and review the publisher and server configuration before starting it.

To view and manage the list of configured MCP servers, run the **MCP: List Servers** command from the Command Palette.

After you add an MCP server, you can [use the tools it provides in agent mode](#_use-mcp-tools-in-agent-mode).

### Add an MCP server to your workspace

To configure an MCP server for a specific workspace, you can create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace folder. This allows you to share the server configuration with project team members.

Important

Make sure to avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys and other credentials by using input variables or environment files.

To add an MCP server to your workspace:

1.  Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace.
    
2.  Select the **Add Server** button to add a template for a new server. VS Code provides IntelliSense for the MCP server configuration file.
    
    The following example shows how to configure a [Perplexity MCP server](https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/), where VS Code prompts you for the API key when the server starts. Learn more about the [Configuration format](#_configuration-format).
    
    ```
    {
      // 💡 Inputs are prompted on first server start, then stored securely by VS Code.
      "inputs": [
        {
          "type": "promptString",
          "id": "perplexity-key",
          "description": "Perplexity API Key",
          "password": true
        }
      ],
      "servers": {
        // https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/
        "Perplexity": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "server-perplexity-ask"],
          "env": {
            "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${input:perplexity-key}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
3.  Alternatively, run the **MCP: Add Server** command from the Command Palette, choose the type of MCP server to add and provide the server information. Next, select **Workspace Settings** to create the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace if it doesn't already exist.

Important

Follow the naming conventions for the server, as specified in the [Configuration format](#_configuration-format) section.

### Add an MCP server to your user settings

To configure an MCP server for all your workspaces, you can add the server configuration to your user settings. This allows you to reuse the same server configuration across multiple projects.

Specify the server in the [mcp](vscode://settings/mcp) VS Code [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/personalize-vscode#_configure-settings) to enable the MCP server across all workspaces.

```
// settings.json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "my-mcp-server": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "my-command",
        "args": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, use the **MCP: Add Server** command from the Command Palette, provide the server information, and then select **User Settings** to add the server configuration to your user settings.

### Automatic discovery of MCP servers

VS Code can automatically detect and reuse MCP servers that you defined in other tools, such as Claude Desktop.

Enable autodiscovery with the [chat.mcp.discovery.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.discovery.enabled) setting.

## Configuration format

Use the following JSON configuration format to define MCP servers.

*   **`"servers": {}`**
    
    Contains the list of MCP servers, and follows Claude Desktop's configuration format.
    
    Specify the server name as the key and provide the server configuration as the value. VS Code shows the server name in the MCP server list. Follow these naming conventions for the server name:
    
    *   Use camelCase for the server name, such as "uiTesting".
    *   Avoid using whitespace or special characters.
    *   Use a unique name for each server to avoid conflicts.
    *   Use a descriptive name that reflects the server's functionality or brand, such as "github" or "database".
    
    Provide the following fields in the server configuration. You can use [predefined variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/variables-reference) in the server configuration, for example to refer to the workspace folder (`${workspaceFolder}`).
    
    Server configuration for \`stdio\`
    
    Field
    
    Description
    
    Examples
    
    `type`
    
    Server connection type.
    
    `"stdio"`
    
    `command`
    
    Command to start the server executable. The command needs to be available on your system path or contain its full path.  
    If you use docker, don't use the detach option.
    
    `"npx"`,`"node"`, `"python"`, `"docker"`
    
    `args`
    
    Array of arguments passed to the command.
    
    `["server.py", "--port", "3000"]`
    
    `env`
    
    Environment variables for the server.
    
    `{"API_KEY": "${input:api-key}"}`
    
    `envFile`
    
    Path to an `.env` from which to load additional environment variables.
    
    `"${workspaceFolder}/.env"`
    
    Server configuration for \`sse\` or \`http\`
    
    Field
    
    Description
    
    Examples
    
    `type`
    
    Server connection type. VS Code first tries the streamable HTTP transport and falls back to SSE if HTTP is not supported.
    
    `"sse"`, `"http"`
    
    `url`
    
    URL of the server.
    
    `"http://localhost:3000"`
    
    `headers`
    
    HTTP headers for the server.
    
    `{"API_KEY": "${input:api-key}"}`
    
*   **`"inputs": []`**
    
    Lets you define custom placeholders for configuration values to avoid hardcoding sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords in the server configuration.
    
    VS Code prompts you for these values when the server starts for the first time, and securely stores them for subsequent use. To avoid showing the typed value, set the `password` field to `true`.
    
    Learn more about how to configure [input variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/variables-reference#_input-variables) in VS Code.

### Configuration example

The following code snippet shows an example MCP server configuration that specifies three servers and defines an input placeholder for the API key.

View \`.vscode/mcp.json\`

```
// Example .vscode/mcp.json
{
  // 💡 Inputs will be prompted on first server start,
  //    then stored securely by VS Code.
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "perplexity-key",
      "description": "Perplexity API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    // https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/
    "Perplexity": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "mcp/perplexity-ask"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${input:perplexity-key}"
      }
    },
    // https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch
    "fetch": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    },
    "my-remote-server": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://api.contoso.com/sse",
      "headers": { "VERSION": "1.2" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use MCP tools in agent mode

Once you have added an MCP server, you can use the tools it provides in agent mode. To use MCP tools in agent mode:

1.  Open the **Chat** view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)), and select **Agent** mode from the dropdown.
    
    ![Agent mode dropdown option](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/chat-mode-agent.png)
    
2.  Select the **Tools** button to view the list of available tools.
    
    Optionally, select or deselect the tools you want to use. You can search tools by typing in the search box.
    
    ![MCP tools list](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/agent-mode-select-tools.png)
    
    Tip
    
    You can also directly reference a tool in your prompt by typing `#` followed by the tool name. You can do this in all chat modes (ask, edit, and agent mode).
    
3.  Select **Add Context** > **MCP Resources** to add resources from the MCP server to your chat context.
    
    For example, a database MCP server might provide access to database tables, or a file system MCP server might provide access to files and directories.
    
4.  You can now enter a prompt in the chat input box and notice how tools are automatically invoked as needed.
    
    By default, when a tool is invoked, you need to confirm the action before it is run. This is because tools might run locally on your machine and might perform actions that modify files or data.
    
    Use the **Continue** button dropdown options to automatically confirm the specific tool for the current session, workspace, or all future invocations.
    
    ![MCP Tool Confirmation](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-tool-confirmation.png)
    
5.  Optionally, verify and edit the tool input parameters before running the tool.
    
    ![MCP Tool Input Parameters](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-tool-edit-parameters.png)

## Use MCP resources

In addition to tools, MCP servers can also provide resources that you can use as context in your chat prompts. For example, a file system MCP server might provide access to files and directories, or a database MCP server might provide access to database tables.

To add a resource from an MCP server to your chat prompt:

1.  In the Chat view, select **Add Context** > **MCP Resources**
    
2.  Select a resource type from the list and provide optional resource input parameters.
    
    ![Screenshot of the MCP resource Quick Pick, showing resource types provided by the GitHub MCP server.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-resources-quick-pick.png)

To view the list of available resources for an MCP server, use the **MCP: Browse Resources** command or use the **MCP: List Servers** > **Browse Resources** command to view resources for a specific server.

MCP tools can return resources as part of their response. You can view or save these resources to your workspace with the **Save** button or by dragging and dropping the resource to the Explorer view.

## Use MCP prompts

MCP servers can provide preconfigured prompts for common tasks, so you don't have to type an elaborate chat prompt. You can directly invoke these prompts in the chat input box by typing `/` followed by the prompt name, formatted as `mcp.servername.promptname`. Optionally, the prompt might ask you for additional input parameters.

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing an MCP prompt invocation and a dialog asking for additional input parameters.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-prompt-invocation.png)

As you add more MCP servers, the list of tools can become long. This can make it tedious to manage individual tools, for example when you want to define a [reusable prompt file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental) or a [custom chat mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes).

To help you manage tools, you can group related tools into a tool set. A tool set is a collection of individual tools that you can refer to as a single entity. A tool set can contain built-in tools, MCP tools, or tools provided by extensions.

Learn more about how to [create and use tool sets in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_define-tool-sets).

## Manage MCP servers

Run the **MCP: List Servers** command from the Command Palette to view the list of configured MCP servers. You can then select a server and perform the following actions on it:

*   **Start**: Start the MCP server if it is not already running.
*   **Stop**: Stop the MCP server if it is running.
*   **Restart**: Restart the MCP server.
*   **Show Output**: View the server logs to diagnose issues.
*   **Show Configuration**: View the server configuration in the editor.
*   **Configure Model Access**: Configure which models the MCP server can access (sampling).
*   **Browse Resources**: View the resources provided by the MCP server.

Tip

When you open the `.vscode/mcp.json` file, VS Code shows commands to start, stop, or restart a server directly from the editor.

![MCP server configuration with lenses to manage server.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-server-config-lenses.png)

### Command-line configuration

You can also use the VS Code command-line interface to add an MCP server to your user profile or to a workspace.

To add an MCP server to your user profile, use the `--add-mcp` command line option, and provide the JSON server configuration in the form `{\"name\":\"server-name\",\"command\":...}`.

```
code --add-mcp "{\"name\":\"my-server\",\"command\": \"uvx\",\"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]}"
```

### URL handler

VS Code also includes a URL handler that you can use to install an MCP server. To form the URL, construct an `obj` object in the same format as you would provide to `--add-mcp`, and then create the link by using the following logic:

```
// For Insiders, use `vscode-insiders` instead of `code`
const link = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(obj))`;
```

This link can be used in a browser, or opened on the command line, for example via `xdg-open $LINK` on Linux.

## Troubleshoot and debug MCP servers

### MCP output log

When VS Code encounters an issue with an MCP server, it shows an error indicator in the Chat view.

![MCP Server Error](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-error-loading-tool.png)

Select the error notification in the Chat view, and then select the **Show Output** option to view the server logs. Alternatively, run **MCP: List Servers** from the Command Palette, select the server, and then choose **Show Output**.

![MCP Server Error Output](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers/mcp-server-error-output.png)

### Debug an MCP server

You can enable _development mode_ for MCP servers by adding a `dev` key to the MCP server configuration. This is an object with two properties:

*   `watch`: A file glob pattern to watch for files change that will restart the MCP server.
*   `debug`: Enables you to set up a debugger with the MCP server.

```
{
  "servers": {
    "gistpad": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["build/index.js"],
     "dev": {
       "watch": "build/**/*.js",
       "debug": { "type": "node" }
     },
```

Note

We currently only support debugging Node.js and Python servers launched with `node` and `python` respectively.

## Create an MCP server

VS Code has all the tools you need to develop your own MCP server. While MCP servers can be written in any language that can handle `stdout`, the MCP's official SDKs are a good place to start:

*   [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
*   [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
*   [Java SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk)
*   [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)
*   [C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk)

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I control which MCP tools are used?

Yes, you have several options to control which tools are active:

*   Select the **Tools** button in the Chat view when in agent mode, and toggle specific tools on/off as needed.
*   Add specific tools to your prompt by using the **Add Context** button or by typing `#`.
*   For more advanced control, you can use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to fine-tune tool usage.

### The MCP server is not starting when using Docker

Verify that the command arguments are correct and that the container is not running in detached mode (`-d` option). You can also check the MCP server output for any error messages (see [Troubleshooting](#_troubleshoot-and-debug-mcp-servers)).

# Inline chat

In this article

With Copilot inline chat in Visual Studio Code, you can ask questions and get suggestions directly in the editor or get help with shell commands within the integrated terminal. Inline chat allows you to stay in the flow of your work without having to switch to a separate Chat view.

## Prerequisites

*   Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
*   Access to [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)

## Use editor inline chat

When you use editor inline chat, your prompt is scoped to the code in the active editor. Inline chat might use the content from other files in your workspace as context for your prompt.

To use editor inline chat:

1.  Open a file in the editor.
    
2.  Open editor inline chat by using the ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) keyboard shortcut or selecting **Editor Inline Chat** from the Copilot menu in the title bar.
    
    Notice how Copilot shows a chat input field at your cursor position in the editor.
    
3.  Enter your prompt in the chat input field.
    
    Select a block of code in the editor to scope the prompt to that code.
    
    Experiment with some of these example prompts to get started:
    
    *   `Refactor this code to use async/await`
    *   `Explain this code`
    *   `Add error handling`
4.  Notice that Copilot shows code suggestions inline in the editor. Accept or reject the changes.
    
    ![Copilot Inline Chat asking to not use recursion for a factorial function.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/inline-chat-no-recursion.png)
    
5.  Optionally, ask a follow-up question to get other or suggestions or refine the results.

## Use terminal inline chat

You can bring up terminal inline chat in the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) to get help with shell commands or ask terminal-related questions.

To use terminal inline chat:

1.  Open the terminal in VS Code by selecting the **View** > **Terminal** menu item or using the ⌃\` (Windows, Linux Ctrl+\`) keyboard shortcut.
    
2.  Open terminal inline chat by using the ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) keyboard shortcut or running the **Terminal Inline Chat** command in the Command Palette.
    
    Copilot shows a chat input field at the current position in the terminal.
    
3.  Enter your prompt in the chat input field.
    
    Experiment with some of these example prompts to get started:
    
    *   `How do I install npm packages?`
    *   `List the top 5 largest files in the src directory`
    *   `undo the last git commit`
    
    ![Screenshot showing that you can ask complex questions like "list the top 5 largest files in the src dir"](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat/terminal-chat-2.png)
    
4.  Review the response and select the **Run** (⌘Enter (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Enter)) to run the command in the terminal

# Prompt engineering for Copilot Chat

In this article

This article covers tips to write prompts to get better and more relevant responses from Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. _Prompt engineering_ or _prompt crafting_ is a common phrase you'll hear when discussing AI and refers to how and what information is packaged and sent to an AI API endpoint.

If you are new to VS Code or GitHub Copilot, you might want to review the [GitHub Copilot Overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview) article first or dive straight into the [Getting started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started) tutorial.

There are different options for optimizing your Copilot experience for inline suggestions and chat:

*   [Get the most out of inline suggestions](#_getting-the-most-out-of-copilot-inline-suggestions)
*   [Get the most out of Copilot Chat](#_getting-the-most-out-of-copilot-chat)

## Getting the most out of Copilot inline suggestions

The [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension presents [suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview#_Code-completions-in-the-editor) automatically to help you code more efficiently. There are things you can do to help ("prompt") Copilot to give you the best possible suggestions. And the good news is that you are probably already doing these right now, since they help you and your colleagues understand your code.

### Provide context to Copilot

Copilot works best when it has sufficient context to know what you're doing and what you want help with. Just as you would provide a colleague with the context when asking for help with a specific programming task, you can do the same with Copilot.

#### Open files

For code completions, Copilot looks at the current and open files in your editor to analyze the context and create appropriate suggestions. Having related files open in VS Code while using Copilot helps set this context and lets the Copilot see a bigger picture of your project.

Just as you would give a brief, high-level introduction to a coworker, a top level comment in the file you're working in can help Copilot understand the overall context of the pieces you are creating.

#### Appropriate includes and references

It's best to manually set the includes or module references you need for your work. Copilot can make suggestions, but you likely know best what dependencies you need to include. This can also help let Copilot know what frameworks, libraries, and their versions you'd like it to use when crafting suggestions.

In the following TypeScript example, we want to log the output of the `add` method. When we don't have any includes, Copilot suggests using `console.log`:

![Copilot inline suggestion proposes Console.log when no imports in the file.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/copilot-suggestion-console-log.png)

On the other hand, when you add a reference to `Log4js`, Copilot suggests using that framework for logging the output:

![Copilot inline suggestion proposes logging using the imported logging framework.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/copilot-suggestion-framework-log.png)

#### Meaningful function names

Just as a method called `fetchData()` won't mean much to a coworker (or you after several months), `fetchData()` won't help Copilot either. Using meaningful function names helps Copilot provide a body that does what you want.

#### Specific and well-scoped function comments

A function name can only be so descriptive without being overly long. Function comments can help fill in details that Copilot might need to know.

#### Prime Copilot with sample code

One trick to get Copilot on the right page, is to copy and paste sample code that is close to what you are looking for into your open editor. Providing a small example can help Copilot generate suggestions that match the language and tasks you want to achieve. Once Copilot begins providing you with the code you want and will actually use, you can delete the sample code from the file. This can be especially helpful to jump start Copilot to a newer library version when it defaults to providing older code suggestions.

### Be consistent and keep the quality bar high

Copilot is going to latch on to your code to generate suggestions that follow the existing pattern, so the adage "garbage in, garbage out" applies.

Always keeping a high quality bar can take discipline. Especially when you're coding fast and loose to get something working, you might want to disable Copilot completions while in "hacking" mode. You can temporarily disable completions from the Copilot status menu. Bring up the Copilot status menu dropdown by selecting the Copilot Status bar item.

![Hover over the Copilot Status bar item displays "Show Copilot status menu"](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/show-copilot-status-menu.png)

From the dropdown, you can disable completions entirely, or disable just for the active file type, for example Markdown files.

![Copilot Status menu dropdown with Disable Completions selected](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/disable-completions.png)

## Getting the most out of Copilot Chat

You can also get assistance from Copilot via a [chat interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview#_Answer-coding-questions) by installing the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension.

When you're using chat to interact with GitHub Copilot, there are several things you can do to optimize your experience.

### Use chat participants and slash commands

Chat participants are designed to collect extra context either about a code base or a specific domain or technology. By using the appropriate participant, Copilot Chat can find and provide better information to send to the Copilot backend. For example, use `@workspace` if you want to ask questions about your open project, or `@vscode` to know more about VS Code features and APIs.

![Asking the @vscode participant how to change the VS Code colors](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/agent-example.png)

Slash commands help Copilot Chat understand your **intent** when you ask a question. Are you learning about a code base (`/explain`), do you want help with fixing an issue (`/fix`), or are you creating test cases (`/tests`)? By letting Copilot Chat know what you're trying to do, it can tune its reply to your task and provide helpful commands, settings, and code snippets.

![Inline Chat slash command list](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/inline-chat-slash-commands.png)

You could write out your project scope or current task with a natural language query but using chat participants and slash commands is more concise and explicit.

Learn more about [chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode#_special-keywords) and [slash commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode#_special-keywords) in Copilot Chat.

### Use chat variables for context

Chat participants, such as `@workspace` or `@vscode`, can contribute chat variables that provide domain-specific context. You can reference a chat variable in your chat prompt by using the `#` symbol. By using a chat variable, you can be more specific about the context that you include in your chat prompt.

For example, with `#<file name>` or `#<folder name>` you can reference specific files or folders from your workspace in your chat prompt. This helps make the answers from Copilot Chat more relevant to your code by providing context about the file you are working with. You can ask questions like "Can you suggest improvements to #package.json?" or "How do I add an extension in #devcontainer.json?".

You can also add context to your chat message by using the **Attach Context** button in the Chat view. You can then select the specific type of context from a Quick Pick, such as the current selection, one or more files from the workspace, or one or more symbols from your source code.

![Screenshot of VS Code Copilot Chat view, showing the Attach context button and context Quick Pick.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/copilot-chat-view-attach-context.png)

Learn more about [using context variables with Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode#_special-keywords).

### Be specific and keep it simple

When you ask Copilot to do something, be specific in your ask and break down a large task into separate, smaller tasks. For example, don't ask Copilot to create an Express app, that uses TypeScript and Pug, and that has a products page that retrieves data from a MongoDB database. Instead, first ask Copilot to create the Express app with TypeScript and Pug. Next, ask to add a products page, and finally ask to retrieve the customer data from a database.

When you ask Copilot to do a specific task, be specific about the inputs, outputs, APIs, or frameworks you want to use. The more specific your prompt is, the better the outcome will be. For example, instead of "read product data from the database", use "read all products by category, return the data in JSON format, and use the Mongoose library".

### Iterate on your solution

When asking Copilot Chat for help, you aren't stuck with the first response. You can iterate and prompt Copilot to improve the solution. Copilot has both the context of the generated code and also your current conversation.

Here's an example using Inline Chat to create a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

![First response from Copilot for a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/fibonacci-first.png)

Maybe you prefer a solution that doesn't use recursion:

![Ask Copilot to not use recursion and new result](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/fibonacci-second.png)

You can even ask Copilot to follow coding conventions or improve variable names:

![Ask Copilot to use better variable names and new result](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting/fibonacci-third.png)

Even if you've already accepted a result, you can always ask Copilot to iterate on the code later.

# Code completions with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

In this article

GitHub Copilot acts as an AI-powered pair programmer, automatically offering suggestions to complete your code, comments, tests, and more. It provides these suggestions directly in the editor while you write your code, and it can work with a broad range of programming languages and frameworks.

Copilot provides two kinds of suggestions:

*   **Code completions** - Start typing in the editor, and Copilot provides code suggestions that match your coding style and take your existing code into account.
    
*   **Next edit suggestions** - Predict your next code edit with Copilot next edit suggestions, aka Copilot NES. Based on the edits you're making, NES both predicts the location of the next edit you'll want to make and what that edit should be.

## Getting started

1.  Install the GitHub Copilot extensions.
    
    > [Install the GitHub Copilot extensions](vscode:extension/GitHub.copilot?referrer=docs-copilot-ai-powered-suggestions)
    
2.  Sign in with your GitHub account to use Copilot.
    
    Tip
    
    If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.
    
3.  Discover the key features of Copilot in VS Code with our [Copilot Quickstart](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started).

## Inline suggestions

Copilot offers code suggestions as you type: sometimes the completion of the current line, sometimes a whole new block of code. You can accept all, or part of a suggestion, or you can keep typing and ignore the suggestions.

Notice in the following example how Copilot suggests an implementation of the `calculateDaysBetweenDates` JavaScript function by using dimmed _ghost text_:

![JavaScript ghost text suggestion.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/js-suggest.png)

When you're presented with an inline suggestion, you can accept it with the Tab key.

Copilot tries to apply the same coding style for the code suggestions that you already have in your code. Notice in the following example that Copilot applies the same input parameter naming scheme from the `add` method for the suggested `subtract` method.

![JavaScript ghost text suggestion.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/ts-suggest-parameter-names.png)

### Partially accepting suggestions

You might not want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot. You can use the ⌘→ (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Right) keyboard shortcut to accept either the next word of a suggestion, or the next line.

### Alternative suggestions

For any given input, Copilot might offer multiple, alternative suggestions. You can hover over the suggestion to any of the other suggestions.

![Hovering over inline suggestions enables you to select from multiple suggestions](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/copilot-hover-highlight.png)

Instead of relying on Copilot to provide suggestions, you can provide hints about what code you expect by using code comments. For example, you could specify a type of algorithm or concept to use (for example, "use recursion" or "use a singleton pattern"), or which methods and properties to add to a class.

The following example shows how to instruct Copilot to create a class in TypeScript to represent a student, providing information about methods and properties:

![Use code comments to let Copilot generate a Student class in TypeScript with properties and methods.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/ts-suggest-code-comment.png)

## Next Edit Suggestions

Inline suggestions are great at autocompleting a section of code. But since most coding activity is editing existing code, it's a natural evolution of Copilot code completions to also help with edits, both at the cursor and further away. Edits are often not made in isolation - there's a logical flow of what edits need to be made in different scenarios. Copilot next edit suggestions (Copilot NES) is this evolution.

Based on the edits you're making, Copilot NES both predicts the location of the next edit you'll want to make and what that edit should be. Copilot NES helps you stay in the flow, suggesting future changes relevant to your current work, and you can simply Tab to quickly navigate and accept Copilot's suggestions. Suggestions may span a single symbol, an entire line, or multiple lines, depending on the scope of the potential change.

To get started with Copilot NES, enable the VS Code setting [github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled](vscode://settings/github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled).

### Navigate and accept edit suggestions

You can quickly navigate to suggested code changes with the Tab key, saving you time to find the next relevant edit (no manual searching through files or references required). You can then accept a suggestion with the Tab key again.

An arrow in the gutter indicates if there is an edit suggestion available. You can hover over the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu, which includes keyboard shortcuts and settings configuration:

![Copilot NES gutter menu expanded](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/gutter-menu-highlighted-updated.png)

If an edit suggestion is below the current editor view, the arrow will point down instead of right:

![Copilot NES with arrow directions changing](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-arrow-directions.gif)

Important

If you are a [VS Code vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) user, please use the latest version of the extension to avoid any conflicts in keybindings with NES.

### Reduce distractions by edit suggestions

By default, edit suggestions are indicated by the gutter arrow and the code changes are shown in the editor. If you prefer to reduce distractions, you can disable showing the code changes in the editor until you press the Tab key to navigate to the suggestion or until you hover over the gutter arrow.

To disable showing the code changes in the editor, enable the [editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed) setting in the Settings editor. Alternatively, hover over the gutter arrow and select the **Show Collapsed** option from the menu. To re-enable showing the code changes, disable the setting or select **Show Expanded** from the gutter arrow menu.

### Use cases for next edit suggestions

**Catching and correcting mistakes**

*   **Copilot helps with simple mistakes like typos.** It'll suggest fixes where letters are missing or swapped, like `cont x = 5` or `conts x = 5`, which should've been `const x = 5`.
    
    ![Copilot NES fixing a typo from "conts" to "const"](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-typo.gif)
    
*   **Copilot can also help with more challenging mistakes in logic**, like an inverted ternary expression:
    
    ![Copilot NES fixing a fibonacci logic mistake](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-fib-logic.gif)
    
    Or a comparison that should've used `&&` instead of `||`:
    
    ![Copilot NES fixing an if statement mistake](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-de-morgan.gif)

**Changing intent**

*   **Copilot suggests changes to the rest of your code that match a new change in intent.** For example, when changing a class from `Point` to `Point3D`, Copilot will suggest to add a `z` variable to the class definition. After accepting the change, Copilot NES next recommends adding `z` to the distance calculation:
    
    ![Copilot NES gif for updating Point to Point3D](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-point.gif)

**Refactoring**

*   **Rename a variable once in a file, and Copilot will suggest to update it everywhere else.** If you use a new name or naming pattern, Copilot suggests to update subsequent code similarly.
    
    ![Copilot NES suggesting change after updating function name](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/nes-gutter.gif)
    
*   **Matching code style**. After copy-pasting some code, Copilot will suggest how to adjust it to match the current code where the paste happened.

## Enable or disable code completions

You can enable or disable code completions either for all languages, or for specific languages only.

*   To enable or disable code completions, select the Copilot menu in the Status Bar, and then check or uncheck the options to enable or disable code completions.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Copilot menu in the Status Bar with checkboxes to enabled or disable code completions and NES.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/copilot-menu-status-bar.png)
    
*   Alternatively, modify the [github.copilot.enable](vscode://settings/github.copilot.enable) setting in the Settings editor.
    
    Add an entry for each language you want to enable or disable code completions for. To enable or disable code completions for all languages, set the value for `*` to `true` or `false`.

## Change the AI model for completions

Different Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on different types of data and might have different capabilities and strengths. Learn more about how to [choose between different AI language models](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/language-models) in VS Code.

To change the language model that is used for generating code completions in the editor:

1.  Open the Command Palette (F1).
    
2.  Type **change completions model** and select the **GitHub Copilot: Change Completions Model** command.
    
3.  In the dropdown menu, select the model you want to use.

Alternatively, if Command Center is enabled, you can click the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar, then click **Configure Code Completions** in the dropdown menu. Then choose **Change Completions Model...** in the dropdown menu and select the model you want to use.

Note

The list of available models might vary and change over time. The model picker may not always show more than one model, and preview models and additional code completion models will become available there if/when we release them. If you are a Copilot Business or Enterprise user, your Administrator needs to enable certain models for your organization by opting in to `Editor Preview Features` in the [Copilot policy settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization) on GitHub.com.

## Tips & tricks

### Context

To give you relevant inline suggestions, Copilot looks at the current and open files in your editor to analyze the context and create appropriate suggestions. Having related files open in VS Code while using Copilot helps set this context and lets Copilot get a bigger picture of your project.

## Settings

### Code completions settings

*   [github.copilot.enable](vscode://settings/github.copilot.enable) - enable or disable inline completions for all or specific languages.
    
*   [editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily) - configure the font for the inline completions.
    
*   [editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar) - enable or disable the toolbar that appears for inline completions.
    
*   [editor.inlineSuggest.syntaxHighlightingEnabled](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.syntaxHighlightingEnabled) - enable or disable syntax highlighting for inline completions.

### Next edit suggestions settings

*   [github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled](vscode://settings/github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled) - enable Copilot next edit suggestions (Copilot NES).
    
*   [editor.inlineSuggest.edits.allowCodeShifting](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.edits.allowCodeShifting) - configure if Copilot NES is able to shift your code to show a suggestion.
    
*   [editor.inlineSuggest.edits.renderSideBySide](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.edits.renderSideBySide) - configure if Copilot NES can show larger suggestions side-by-side if possible, or if Copilot NES should always show larger suggestions below the relevant code.
    
    *   **auto (default)**: show larger edit suggestions side-by-side if there is enough space in the viewport, otherwise the suggestions are shown below the relevant code.
    *   **never**: never show suggestions side-by-side, always show suggestions below the relevant code.

## Next steps

*   Discover the key features with the [Copilot Quickstart](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/getting-started-chat).
    
*   Use AI chat conversations with [Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat).

# Copilot smart actions in Visual Studio Code

In this article

For several common scenarios, you can use _smart actions_ to get help from Copilot without having to write a prompt. Examples of these smart actions are generating commit messages, generating documentation, explaining or fixing code, or performing a code review. These smart actions are available throughout the VS Code UI.

## Generate a commit message and PR information

Copilot can help generate commit messages and the PR title and description based on the code changes in a commit or the changes in a pull request. Use the _sparkle_ icon in the Source Control view or GitHub PR extension to generate a title and description that summarizes your changes.

![Hover over Source Control input box sparkle buttons shows Generate Commit Message](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/generate-commit-message.png)

## Rename symbols

When you rename a symbol in your code, Copilot suggests a new name based on the context of the symbol and the codebase.

![Inline chat suggesting a new name for a symbol in a Python file](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/copilot-inline-chat-rename-suggestion.png)

## Generate alt text for images in Markdown

Use AI to generate or update alt text for images in Markdown files. To generate alt text:

1.  Open a Markdown file.
    
2.  Put the cursor on an image link.

4.  Optionally, refine the generated tests by providing additional context in the Inline Chat prompt.

## Explain code

Copilot can help with explaining a piece of code.

1.  Open your application code file.
    
2.  Select the code you want to fix.
    
3.  Right-click and select **Copilot** > **Explain**.
    
    Copilot provides an explanation of the selected block of code.

## Fix coding errors

To fix coding issues for your application code without writing a prompt, you can use the editor smart actions.

1.  Open your application code file.
    
2.  Select the code you want to fix.
    
3.  Right-click and select **Copilot** > **Fix**.
    
    Copilot provides a code suggestion to fix the code.
    
4.  Optionally, refine the generated code by providing additional context in the chat prompt.

Alternatively, if there's a compile or linting problem in a code file, Copilot shows a code action in the editor to help resolve the issue.

![Screenshot of the editor showing the sparkle icon and Copilot context menu to explain or fix the issue.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/copilot-code-action-fix.png)

## Fix testing errors

Copilot integrates with the Test Explorer in VS Code and can help with fixing failing tests.

1.  In the Test Explorer, hover over a failing test
2.  Select the **Fix Test Failure** button (sparkle icon)
3.  Review and apply Copilot's suggested fix

Alternatively, you can:

1.  Open the Chat view
2.  Enter the `/fixTestFailure` command
3.  Follow Copilot's suggestions to fix the test

Tip

[Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) monitors the test output when running tests, and automatically attempts to fix and rerun failing tests.

## Fix terminal errors

When a command fails to run in the terminal, Copilot displays a sparkle in the gutter that offers a Quick Fix to explain what happened.

![Fix with Copilot option in the terminal after a failed terminal command.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/terminal-command-explanation.png)

## Review code

Copilot can help with reviewing your code, either for a code block in the editor or all changes included in a pull request (requires the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)).

To review a code block in the editor:

1.  Open your application code file.
    
2.  Select the code you want to fix.
    
3.  Right-click and select **Copilot** > **Review and Comment**.
    
    Copilot creates review comments in the **Comments** panel and also shows them inline in the editor.

To review all changes in a pull request:

1.  Create a pull request with the GitHub Pull Requests extension
    
2.  Select the **Copilot Code Review** button in the **Files Changed** view.
    
    Copilot creates review comments in the **Comments** panel and also shows them inline in the editor.

## Semantic search results (Preview)

The Search view in VS Code enables you to search for text across your files. Semantic search enables you to find results that are semantically relevant to your search query, even if they don't match the text exactly. This is particularly useful when you're looking for code snippets or documentation that relate to a concept rather than a specific term, or when you don't know the exact terms to search for.

![Search view showing semantic search results that are not an exact match for the search criteria.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/semantic-search-results.png)

Configure semantic search in the Search view with the [search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior](vscode://settings/search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior) setting. You can choose to run semantic search automatically, or only when you explicitly request it.

You can also get AI-generated keyword suggestions in the Search view to provide relevant alternative search terms. Enable search keyword suggestions with the [search.searchView.keywordSuggestions](vscode://settings/search.searchView.keywordSuggestions) setting.

![Search view showing keyword suggestions based on the search query.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/search-keyword-suggestions.png)

You can reference search results in your chat prompt by selecting **Get results from the search view** from the **Add Context** Quick Pick. Alternatively, type `#searchResults` in the chat prompt.

## Search settings with AI (Experimental)

If you don't know the exact name of a setting you want to change, you can use AI to help find the relevant settings based on your search query. For example, you can search for "increase text size" to find the setting that controls the editor font size.

Enable this functionality with the [workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle](vscode://settings/workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle) setting. In the Settings editor, you can then toggle the AI search results on or off with the **Search Settings with AI** button.

![Screenshot that shows the Settings editor showing AI-generated suggestions for settings.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/copilot-smart-actions/settings-suggestions.png)

# Customize AI responses in VS Code

In this article

Chat in Visual Studio Code can give you responses and generate code that matches your coding practices and project requirements, if you give it the right context. Instead of repeatedly adding this information in every chat prompt, you can store this context in files and automatically include it in every chat request. In this article, you learn how to use custom instructions and prompt files to customize AI responses in VS Code.

There are three main ways to customize AI responses in Visual Studio Code:

*   **Custom instructions**: Define common guidelines or rules for tasks like generating code, performing code reviews, or generating commit messages. Custom instructions describe the conditions in which the AI should perform operate (_how_ a task should be done). Learn how to [define custom instructions](#_custom-instructions).
    
    Example scenarios
    
    *   Specify coding practices, preferred technologies, or project requirements, so generated code follows your standards.
    *   Set rules for code reviews, such as checking for security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
    *   Provide instructions for generating commit messages or pull request titles and descriptions.
    
*   **Prompt files**: Define reusable prompts for common tasks like generating code or performing a code review. Prompt files are standalone prompts that you can run directly in chat. They describe the task to be performed (_what_ should be done). Optionally, you can include tasks-specific guidelines about how the task should be performed, or you can reference custom instructions in the prompt file. Learn how to [create prompt files](#_prompt-files-experimental).
    
    Example scenarios
    
    *   Create reusable prompts for common coding tasks, such as scaffolding a new component, API route, or generating tests.
    *   Define prompts for performing code reviews, such as checking for code quality, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues.
    *   Create step-by-step guides for complex processes or project-specific patterns.
    *   Define prompts for generating implementation plans, architectural designs, or migration strategies.
    
*   **Custom chat modes**: Define how chat operates, which tools it can use, and how it interacts with the codebase. Each chat prompt is run within the boundaries of the chat mode, without having to configure tools and instructions for every request.
    
    Example scenarios
    
    *   Create a chat mode for planning, where the AI has read-only access to the codebase and can only generate implementation plans.
    *   Define a research chat mode, where the AI can reach out to external resources to explore new technologies or gather information.
    *   Create a front-end developer chat mode, where the AI can only generate and modify code related to front-end development.

## Custom instructions

Custom instructions enable you to describe common guidelines or rules to get responses that match your specific coding practices and tech stack. Instead of manually including this context in every chat query, custom instructions automatically incorporate this information with every chat request.

### Types of custom instructions

VS Code supports multiple ways to define custom instructions:

Custom instructions type

Description

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` file

*   Describe code-generation instructions in Markdown.
*   All instructions are combined in a single file, stored within the workspace.
*   Instructions are automatically included in every chat request.
*   Supported across all editors and IDEs that support Copilot.
*   Use this file to define general coding practices, preferred technologies, and project requirements that apply to all code-generation tasks.

`.instructions.md` files

*   Describe code-generation instructions in Markdown.
*   Create one or more instructions files, stored in the workspace or your user profile.
*   Use glob patterns to automatically include instructions for all requests or for specific files.
*   Supported in VS Code.
*   Use these files if you want to have task-specific code-generation instructions, and to have more control over when to include instructions with your chat prompt.

VS Code settings

*   Specify instructions in VS Code user or workspace settings.
*   Define instructions in settings values or in one or more files.
*   Supported in VS Code.
*   Supports instructions for code generation, test generation, commit messages, code review, and PR titles and descriptions.
*   Use this option to define instructions for tasks other than code-generation.

You can use a combination of these approaches to define custom instructions and the instructions are all included in the chat request. No particular order or priority is applied to the instructions, so make sure to avoid conflicting instructions in the files.

### Custom instructions examples

The following examples demonstrates how to use custom instructions:

Example: general coding guidelines

```
---
applyTo: "**"
---
# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
```
Example: TypeScript and React coding guidelines

Notice how these instructions reference the general coding guidelines file. You can separate the instructions into multiple files to keep them organized and focused on specific topics.

```
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---
# Project coding standards for TypeScript and React

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS modules for component styling
```

### Use a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file

You can store custom instructions in your workspace or repository in a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and describe your coding practices, preferred technologies, and project requirements by using Markdown. These instructions only apply to the workspace where the file is located.

VS Code automatically includes the instructions from the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in every chat request and applies them for generating code.

To use a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file:

1.  Set the [github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles) setting to `true` to instruct VS Code to use the custom instructions file.
    
2.  Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file at the root of your workspace. If needed, create a `.github` directory first.
    
3.  Describe your instructions by using natural language and in Markdown format.
    
    Whitespace between instructions is ignored, so the instructions can be written as a single paragraph, each on a new line, or separated by blank lines for legibility.

Note

GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio and GitHub.com also detect the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. If you have a workspace that you use in both VS Code and Visual Studio, you can use the same file to define custom instructions for both editors.

### Use `.instructions.md` files

You can also create one or more `.instructions.md` files to store custom instructions for specific tasks. For example, you can create instruction files for different programming languages, frameworks, or project types.

VS Code can automatically add instructions files to all chat requests, or you can specify for which files the instructions should be applied automatically. Alternatively, you can manually attach instructions files to a chat prompt.

VS Code supports two types of scopes for instruction files:

*   **Workspace instructions files**: are only available within the workspace and are stored in the `.github/instructions` folder of the workspace.
*   **User instruction files**: are available across multiple workspaces and are stored in the current [VS Code profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles).

#### Instructions file structure

An instructions file is a Markdown file with the `.instructions.md` file suffix. The instructions file consists of two sections:

*   (Optional) Header with metadata (Front Matter syntax)
    
    *   `description`: A brief description of the instructions file. This description is displayed when you hover the instructions file in the Chat view.
        
    *   `applyTo`: Specify a glob pattern for files to which the instructions are automatically applied. To always include the custom instructions, use the `**` pattern.
        
        For example, the following instructions file is always applied:
        
        ```
        ---
        applyTo: "**"
        ---
        Add a comment at the end of the file: 'Contains AI-generated edits.'
        ```
        
*   Body with the instruction content
    
    Specify the custom instructions in natural language by using Markdown formatting. You can use headings, lists, and code blocks to structure the instructions.
    
    You can reference other instruction files by using Markdown links. Use relative paths to reference these files, and ensure that the paths are correct based on the location of the instruction file.

#### Create an instructions file

To create an instructions file:

1.  Run the **Chat: New Instructions File** command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).
    
2.  Choose the location where the instruction file should be created.
    
    User instruction files are stored in the [current profile folder](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles). You can sync your user instruction files across multiple devices by using [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings-sync). Make sure to configure the **Prompts and Instructions** setting in the **Settings Sync: Configure** command.
    
    By default, workspace instruction files are stored in the `.github/instructions` folder of your workspace. Add more instruction folders for your workspace with the [chat.instructionsFilesLocations](vscode://settings/chat.instructionsFilesLocations) setting.
    
3.  Enter a name for your instruction file.
    
4.  Author the custom instructions by using Markdown formatting.
    
    Reference additional workspace files as Markdown links (`[index](../index.ts)`), or as `#index.ts` references within the instructions file.

Use the **Chat: Configure Instructions** command from the Command Palette to select and edit an existing instructions file. This command opens the instruction file in the editor, where you can edit the instructions and metadata.

#### Use an instructions file in chat

To manually attach an instructions file to a chat prompt:

*   In the Chat view, select **Add Context** > **Instructions** and select the instruction file from the Quick Pick.
    
*   Run the **Chat: Attach Instructions** command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) and select the instruction file from the Quick Pick.

To automatically apply instructions files, specify the `applyTo` metadata property in the instructions file:

*   `**`: Apply the instructions for all chat requests.
*   `<glob pattern>`: Apply the instructions based on the types of files that are in the chat context.

### Specify custom instructions in settings

You can configure custom instructions in your user or workspace settings. This is useful to specify custom instructions for scenarios other than code generation. VS Code automatically applies the custom instructions from settings to the chat requests or to the specific tasks.

There are specific settings for different scenarios. The following table lists the settings for each type of custom instruction.

Type of instruction

Setting name

Code generation

[github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions)

Test generation

[github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions)

Code review

[github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions)

Commit message generation

[github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions)

Pull request title and description generation

[github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions)

You can define the custom instructions as text in the settings value (`text` property) or reference an external file (`file` property) in your workspace.

The following code snippet shows how to define a set of instructions in the `settings.json` file.

```
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'."
    },
    {
      "text": "In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names."
    },
    {
      "file": "general.instructions.md" // import instructions from file `general.instructions.md`
    },
    {
      "file": "db.instructions.md" // import instructions from file `db.instructions.md`
    }
  ],
```

### Tips for defining custom instructions

*   Keep your instructions short and self-contained. Each instruction should be a single, simple statement. If you need to provide multiple pieces of information, use multiple instructions.
    
*   Don't refer to external resources in the instructions, such as specific coding standards.
    
*   Split instructions into multiple files. This approach is useful for organizing instructions by topic or type of task.
    
*   Make it easy to share custom instructions with your team or across projects by storing your instructions in instruction files. You can also version control the files to track changes over time.
    
*   Use the `applyTo` property in the instruction file header to automatically apply the instructions to specific files or folders.
    
*   Reference custom instructions in your prompt files to keep your prompts clean and focused, and to avoid duplicating instructions for different tasks.

## Prompt files (experimental)

Prompt files are reusable prompts for common tasks like generating code or performing a code review. You define the prompt content in a Markdown file. A prompt file is a standalone prompt that you can run directly in chat. Optionally, you can also include guidelines about how the task should be performed.

Tip

Prompt files can take advantage of instruction files to reuse common guidelines and have task-specific instructions included in the prompt. For example, a security review prompt file can reference a custom instructions that describe general security practices, while also including specific instructions on how to report the findings of the review.

VS Code supports two types of scopes for prompt files:

*   **Workspace prompt files**: Are only available within the workspace and are stored in the `.github/prompts` folder of the workspace.
*   **User prompt files**: Are available across multiple workspaces and are stored in the current [VS Code profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles).

### Prompt file examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use prompt files:

Example: generate a React form component

```
---
mode: 'agent'
tools: ['githubRepo', 'codebase']
description: 'Generate a new React form component'
---
Your goal is to generate a new React form component based on the templates in #githubRepo contoso/react-templates.

Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

Requirements for the form:
* Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
* Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
* Always define TypeScript types for your form data
* Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
* Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
* Use `yup` for validation:
* Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
* Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
* Customize UX-friendly validation rules
```
Example: perform a security review of a REST API

```
---
mode: 'edit'
description: 'Perform a REST API security review'
---
Perform a REST API security review:

* Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
* Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
* Implement rate limiting and throttling
* Implement logging and monitoring for security events
```

### Prompt file structure

A prompt file is a Markdown file with the `.prompt.md` file suffix. It has the following two main sections:

*   (Optional) Header with metadata (Front Matter syntax)
    
    *   `mode`: The chat mode to use when running the prompt: `ask`, `edit`, or `agent` (default).
    *   `tools`: Array of tool (set) names to indicate which tools (sets) can be used in agent mode. Select **Configure Tools** to select the tools from the list of available tools in your workspace. If a given tool (set) is not available when running the prompt, it is ignored.
    *   `description`: A short description of the prompt.
*   Body with the prompt content
    
    Prompt files mimic the format of writing prompts in chat. This allows blending natural language instructions, additional context, and even linking to other prompt files as dependencies. You can use Markdown formatting to structure the prompt content, including headings, lists, and code blocks.

You can reference other workspace files, prompt files, or instructions files by using Markdown links. Use relative paths to reference these files, and ensure that the paths are correct based on the location of the prompt file.

Within a prompt file, you can reference variables by using the `${variableName}` syntax. You can reference the following variables:

*   Workspace variables - `${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolderBasename}`
*   Selection variables - `${selection}`, `${selectedText}`
*   File context variables - `${file}`, `${fileBasename}`, `${fileDirname}`, `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`
*   Input variables - `${input:variableName}`, `${input:variableName:placeholder}` (pass values to the prompt from the chat input field)

### Create a workspace prompt file

Workspace prompt files are stored in your workspace and are only available in that workspace.

By default, prompt files are located in the `.github/prompts` directory of your workspace. You can specify additional prompt file locations with the [chat.promptFilesLocations](vscode://settings/chat.promptFilesLocations) setting.

To create a workspace prompt file:

1.  Run the **Chat: New Prompt File** command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).
    
2.  Choose the location where the prompt file should be created.
    
    By default, only the `.github/prompts` folder is available. Add more prompt folders for your workspace with the [chat.promptFilesLocations](vscode://settings/chat.promptFilesLocations) setting.
    
3.  Enter a name for your prompt file.
    
    Alternatively, you can directly create a `.prompt.md` file in the prompts folder of your workspace.
    
4.  Author the chat prompt by using Markdown formatting.
    
    Within a prompt file, reference additional workspace files as Markdown links (`[index](../index.ts)`), or as `#index.ts` references within the prompt file.
    
    You can also reference other `.prompt.md` files to create a hierarchy of prompts. You can also reference [instructions files](#_custom-instructions) in the same way.

### Create a user prompt file

User prompt files are stored in your [user profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles). With user prompt files, you can share reusable prompts across multiple workspaces.

To create a user prompt file:

1.  Select the **Chat: New Prompt File** command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).
    
2.  Select **User Data Folder** as the location for the prompt file.
    
    If you use multiple [VS Code profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles), the prompt file is created in the current profile's user data folder.
    
3.  Enter a name for your prompt file.
    
4.  Author the chat prompt by using Markdown formatting.
    
    You can also reference other user prompt files or user instruction files.

### Use a prompt file in chat

You have multiple options to run a prompt file:

*   Run the **Chat: Run Prompt** command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) and select a prompt file from the Quick Pick.
    
*   In the Chat view, type `/` followed by the prompt file name in the chat input field.
    
    This option enables you to pass additional information in the chat input field. For example, `/create-react-form` or `/create-react-form: formName=MyForm`.
    
*   Open the prompt file in the editor, and press the play button in the editor title area. You can choose to run the prompt in the current chat session or open a new chat session.
    
    This option is useful for quickly testing and iterating on your prompt files.

### Sync user prompt files across devices

VS Code can sync your user prompt files across multiple devices by using [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings-sync).

To sync your user prompt files, enable Settings Sync for prompt and instruction files:

1.  Make sure you have [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings-sync) enabled.
    
2.  Run **Settings Sync: Configure** from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).
    
3.  Select **Prompts and Instructions** from the list of settings to sync.

## Centrally manage instructions and prompt files in VS Code

Enable or disable instructions and prompt files in VS Code with the [chat.promptFiles](vscode://settings/chat.promptFiles) setting.

To centrally enable or disable this setting within your organization, check [Centrally Manage VS Code Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_centrally-manage-vs-code-settings) in the enterprise documentation.

## https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/language-models

# AI language models in VS Code

In this article

Copilot in Visual Studio Code offers different built-in language models that are optimized for different tasks. You can also bring your own language model API key to use models from other providers. This article describes how to change the language model for chat or code completions, and how to use your own API key.

## Choose the right model for your task

By default, Copilot Chat uses a base model to provide fast, capable responses for a wide range of tasks, such as coding, summarization, knowledge-based questions, reasoning, and more.

However, you are not limited to using this model. You can choose from a selection of other models, each with its own particular strengths. You may have a favorite model that you like to use, or you might prefer to use a particular model for inquiring about a specific subject.

Model type

Models

Fast coding

*   GPT-4o
*   Claude Sonnet 3.5
*   Claude Sonnet 3.7
*   Gemini 2.0 Flash

Reasoning/planning

*   Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking
*   o1
*   o3-mini

For a detailed comparison of AI models, see [Choosing the right AI model for your task](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task) in the GitHub Copilot documentation.

Depending on which [chat mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat#_chat-mode) you are using, the list of available models might be different. In agent mode, the list of models is limited to those that have good support for tool calling.

The list of [models available in Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat?tool=vscode) can change over time.

Note

If you are a Copilot Business or Enterprise user, your administrator needs to enable certain models for your organization by opting in to `Editor Preview Features` in the [Copilot policy settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization) on GitHub.com.

## Why use your own language model API key?

Developers can now leverage models directly from Anthropic, Azure, Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Ollama directly by providing a valid API key. Learn how to [use your own API in VS Code](#_bring-your-own-language-model-key).

Using your own language model API key in VS Code has several advantages:

*   **Model choice**: access hundreds of models from different providers, beyond the built-in models.
*   **Experimentation**: experiment with new models or features that are not yet available in the built-in models.
*   **Local compute**: use your own compute for one of the models already supported in GitHub Copilot or to run models not yet available.
*   **Greater control**: by using your own key, you can bypass the standard rate limits and restrictions imposed on the built-in models.

Important

This feature is currently in preview and is not currently available to Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise users.

## Change the model for chat conversations

Use the language model picker in the chat input field to change the model that is used for chat conversations and code editing.

![Screenshot that shows the model picker in the Chat view.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/language-models/model-dropdown-change-model.png)

You can further extend the list of available models by [using your own language model API key](#_bring-your-own-language-model-key).

If you have a paid Copilot plan, the model picker shows the premium request multiplier for premium models. Learn more about [premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#premium-requests) in the GitHub Copilot documentation.

## Change the model for code completions

To change the language model that is used for generating code completions in the editor:

1.  Select **Configure Code Completions...** from the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar.
    
2.  Select **Change Completions Model...**, and then select one of the models from the list.

## Bring your own language model key

If you already have an API key for a language model provider, you can use their models in chat in VS Code, in addition to the built-in models that Copilot provides. You can use models from the following providers: Anthropic, Azure, Google Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter.

Important

This feature is currently in preview and is not currently available to Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise users.

To manage the available models for chat:

1.  Select **Manage Models** from the language model picker in the Chat view.
    
    Alternatively, run the **GitHub Copilot: Manage Models** command from the Command Palette.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the model picker in the Chat view, which has an item for managing the list of models.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/language-models/model-dropdown-change-model.png)
    
2.  Select a model provider from the list.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the model provider Quick Pick.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/language-models/model-provider-quick-pick.png)
    
3.  Enter the provider-specific details, such as the API key or endpoint URL.
    
4.  Enter the model details or select a model from the list, if available for the provider.
    
    The following screenshot shows the model picker for Ollama running locally, with the Phi-4 model deployed.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the model picker of Ollama running locally, allowing you to select a model from the list of available models.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/language-models/ollama-installed-models-quick-pick.png)
    
5.  You can now select the model from the model picker in the Chat view and use it for chat conversations.

### Update the provider details

To update the provider details, such as the API key or endpoint URL:

1.  Select **Manage Models** from the language model picker in the Chat view.
    
    Alternatively, run the **GitHub Copilot: Manage Models** command from the Command Palette.
    
2.  Hover over a model provider in the list, and select the gear icon to edit the provider details.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the model provider Quick Pick, with a gear icon next to the provider name.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/language-models/reconfigure-model-provider.png)
    
3.  Update the provider details, such as the API key or endpoint URL.

### Considerations

There are a number of considerations when using your own language model API key in VS Code:

*   Bringing your own model only applies to the chat experience and doesn't impact code completions or other AI-powered features in VS Code, such as commit-message generation.
*   The capabilities of each model might differ from the built-in models and could affect the chat experience. For example, some models might not support vision or tool calling.
*   The Copilot API is still used for some tasks, such as sending embeddings, repository indexing, query refinement, intent detection, and side queries.
*   When using your own model, there is no guarantee that responsible AI filtering is applied to the model's output.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why is bring your own model key not available for Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise?

Bringing your own model key is not available for Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise because it's mainly meant to allow users to experiment with the newest models the moment they are announced, and not yet available as a built-in model in Copilot.

Bringing your own model key will come to Copilot Business and Enterprise plans later this year, as we better understand the requirements that organizations have for using this functionality at scale. Copilot Business and Enterprise users can still use the built-in, managed models.

# Edit Jupyter notebooks with AI in VS Code

In this article

Visual Studio Code supports working with [Jupyter notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) natively, and through [Python code files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py). The AI features in VS Code can help you in creating and editing notebooks, as well as analyzing and visualizing data. In this article, you learn how to use the AI features in VS Code to work with Jupyter notebooks.

## Scaffold a new notebook

To accelerate getting started with a new notebook, you can use the AI features in VS Code to scaffold a new notebook. You can provide details about what functionality you want to add and which libraries you want to use.

To create a new notebook with AI, choose the [chat mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat#_chat-mode) and enter a prompt in the Chat view.

With [ask mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask) in chat, use the `/newNotebook` command in the chat input field to indicate that you want to scaffold a new notebook.

[Agent mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent) provides a more autonomous experience, where it can make changes to the notebook, run the cells, and monitor and resolve potential run-time issues.

Example prompts:

*   _Create a Jupyter notebook to read data from #housing.csv_
*   _Create a Jupyter notebook to read data from #housing.csv, add a step to clean the data_
*   _Create a notebook to read data from #housing.csv and plot the distribution of prices_
*   _/newNotebook using pandas and seaborn to read and visualize the titanic dataset. Show key information from the dataset._ (ask mode)
*   _Create a Jupyter notebook to read data from #housing.csv. Run all cells._ (agent mode)

The following screenshot shows how the output from agent mode to the prompt _Create a Jupyter notebook to read data from #housing.csv_ (you can get this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=housing+dataset+in%3Adatasets)):

![Screenshot that shows a new notebook created by agent mode that reads the 'housing.csv' file in the workspace.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/agent-mode-create-new-notebook.png)

Notice that a new `.ipynb` file is created in the workspace, which contains Markdown and code cells for reading the CSV file and displaying the first few rows of the data.

You can now further edit the notebook manually, or use AI to make inline edits or send follow-up chat requests to modify the notebook.

## Make inline edits in notebooks

If you already have a notebook and want to make some inline changes in a cell, you can use inline chat, like you would in a code file.

To make inline edits in a cell, press ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) or right-click in the cell and select **Copilot** > **Editor Inline Chat**. This opens the inline chat view, where you can enter your prompt.

Tip

You can reference kernel variables in your chat prompt. Type `#` followed by the variable name to reference it. For example, if you have a variable named `df`, you can type `#df` in your chat prompt to reference it.

![Screenshot that shows the inline chat view in a notebook cell.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/notebook-inline-chat.png)

When the response is generated, notice that the code is updated in the notebook cell. You can **Accept** the changes and decide to **Accept and Run** the cell changes.

To generate a new cell with AI, select the **Generate** button in the notebook view, or don't focus on a cell and press ⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+I) to open the inline chat view for a new cell.

## Make edits across multiple cells

To make larger edits, across multiple cells, you can use the chat interface in [edit mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=edit) or [agent mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent).

Example prompts:

*   _Plot a graph of the price distribution_
*   _Make sure the data is cleaned before visualizing and processing it_
*   _Show the correlation between different features in the dataset_
*   _Use matplotlib instead of seaborn to plot the data_
*   _Remove the display of dataset information_

![Screenshot that shows the response from edit mode to the prompt 'Plot a graph of the price distribution'.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/notebook-edit-mode-plot-prices.png)

Notice that you can use the overlay controls to navigate between the different edit suggestions, and to keep or undo the changes.

## Ask questions about notebook content

You can use the chat interface to ask questions about the content of your notebook. This is useful for getting explanations of code, data, or visualizations. You can add extra context to your chat request, such as the cell output, graphs, or errors.

The following example shows how to ask questions about a visualization in a notebook.

1.  Change to [ask mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=ask) in chat.
    
2.  Select `...` next to the graph, and select **Add Cell Output to Chat** to add the chart as context to your chat request.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the context menu for a graph in a notebook cell.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/notebook-ask-mode-add-cell-output.png)
    
3.  Enter the prompt _Explain this chart_ in the chat input field.
    
    Notice that you get a detailed explanation of the chart.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the response from chat to the prompt 'Explain this chart'.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/notebook-ask-mode-explain-chart.png)

## Perform data analysis and visualization

You can do a full data analysis and visualization notebook of a dataset by using agent mode in chat. Agent mode analyzes the dataset, and then scaffolds a new notebook, implements the code for performing the data analysis, and runs the cells to process and visualize the data. As needed, agent mode invokes relevant tools and terminal commands to complete its tasks.

For example, to perform a data analysis of the housing dataset:

1.  Open [agent mode](vscode://GitHub.Copilot-Chat/chat?mode=agent) in chat.
    
2.  Enter the following prompt in the chat input field: _Perform data analysis of the data in #housing.csv_.
    
    Notice that agent mode iterates through the different tasks. When needed, approve the tool and command invocations.
    
3.  The result is a new notebook with a complete data analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows the response from agent mode to the prompt 'Perform data analysis of the data in housing.csv'.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/guides/notebooks-with-ai/notebook-agent-mode-data-analysis.png)

You can now further edit the notebook manually, or use AI to make inline edits or send follow-up chat requests to modify the notebook.

3.  Follow Copilot's guidance to set up debugging for your project.

Alternatively, you can use a natural language prompt like:

*   "Create a debug configuration for a Django app"
*   "Set up debugging for a React Native app"
*   "Configure debugging for a Flask application"

## Start debugging with Copilot

The `copilot-debug` terminal command simplifies the process of configuring and starting a debugging session. Prefix the command you'd use for starting your application with `copilot-debug` to have Copilot automatically configure and start a debugging session.

1.  Open the integrated terminal (⌃\` (Windows, Linux Ctrl+\`)).
    
2.  Enter `copilot-debug` followed by your application's start command. For example:
    
    ```
    copilot-debug node app.js
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```
    copilot-debug python manage.py
    ```
    
3.  Copilot launches a debugging session for your application. You can now use the built-in debugging features in VS Code.

# Tips and tricks for Copilot in VS Code

In this article

This article provides tips and tricks to optimize your development experience for using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

## Checklist for using Copilot in VS Code

Use the following checklist to get the most out of Copilot:

1.  [Choose the right tool](#_choose-the-right-copilot-tool). _Use the tool that's optimized for editing, asking questions, or staying in the flow of writing code._
    
2.  [Personalize Copilot](#_personalize-copilot-with-instructions-files). _Use custom instructions to get code suggestions that match your style and coding practices._
    
3.  [Write effective prompts](#_prompt-engineering) and provide [context](#_provide-the-right-context-and-tools). _Get the most relevant responses._
    
4.  [Index your workspace](#_workspace-indexing). _Receive accurate responses to questions about your codebase._
    
5.  [Choose your AI model](#_choose-your-ai-model). _Choose between models for fast coding or planning/reasoning._
    
6.  [Reuse prompts](#_reusable-prompts). _Save time by saving and reusing task-specific prompts across your team._

## Choose the right Copilot tool

Depending on your task, you can choose between different Copilot tools.

Tool

Use case

[Code completions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions)

Streamline coding while staying in the flow.  
Receive inline suggestions for code snippets, variable names, and functions as you write them in the editor.

[Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)

Have an ongoing chat conversation for brainstorming design ideas or getting code suggestions, optionally calling on domain-specific chat participants.  
Choose to apply specific code suggestions to your codebase.

[Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits)

Use natural language to start a coding editing session.  
Automatically apply large code changes across multiple files in your workspace.

[Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)

Implement high-level requirements by starting an agentic coding flow.  
Copilot autonomously invokes multiple tools to plan and implement the code changes and tasks that are needed.

## Personalize Copilot with instructions files

When Copilot generates code or answers questions, it tries to match your coding practices and preferences such as which libraries you use or how you name your variables. However, it might not always have enough context to do this effectively. For example, if you work with a specific framework version, you need to provide additional context in your prompts.

To enhance AI responses, you can use _instructions files_ to provide contextual details about your team's coding practices, tools, or project specifics. You can then attach these instructions to your chat prompt, or have them applied automatically.

To enable instructions files for your workspace:

1.  Run the **Chat: New Instructions File** command from the Command Palette.
    
    This command creates a `.instructions.md` file in `.github/instructions` folder.
    
2.  Add your instructions in Markdown format to the file. For example:
    
    ```
    # Custom instructions for Copilot
    
    ## Project context
    This project is a web application built with React and Node.js.
    
    ## Indentation
    We use tabs, not spaces.
    
    ## Coding style
    Use camelCase for variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.
    
    ## Testing
    We use Jest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing.
    ```
    
3.  Optionally, add a glob pattern to the `applyTo` metadata field to specify which files the instructions apply to.
    
    ```
    ---
    applyTo: "**/*.ts"
    ---
    Coding practices for TypeScript files.
    ...
    ```

Get more details about [using instructions files in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_instruction-files).

## Prompt engineering

You can enhance the quality of Copilot's responses by using effective prompts. A well-crafted prompt can help Copilot understand your requirements better and generate more relevant code suggestions.

*   Start general, then get specific.
    
    ```
    Generate a Calculator class.
    Add methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial.
    Don't use any external libraries and don't use recursion.
    ```
    
*   Give examples of what you want.
    
    ```
    Generate a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in it.
    Example:
    findVowels("hello") returns 2
    findVowels("sky") returns 0
    ```
    
*   Break down complex tasks into simpler tasks.
    
    Instead of asking Copilot to generate a meal planner app, break it down into smaller tasks:
    
    *   Generate a function that takes a list of ingredients and returns a list of recipes.
    *   Generate a function that takes a list of recipes and returns a shopping list.
    *   Generate a function that takes a list of recipes and returns a meal plan for the week.
*   Provide the [right context](#_provide-the-right-context), such as code selections, files, terminal output, and more.
    
    Example, use the `#codebase` variable to refer to the entire codebase:
    
    ```
    Where is the database connection string used in #codebase?
    ```
    
*   Iterate on your prompts.
    
    Provide follow-up prompts to refine or modify the response. For example:
    
    *   "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number."
    *   "Don't use recursion and optimize by using caching."
    *   "Use meaningful variable names."
*   Keep chat history relevant.
    
    Copilot uses history of the conversation to provide context. Remove past questions and responses from the history if they're not relevant. Or, start a new session if you want to change the context.

Get more details about [prompt engineering](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting).

Find practical [examples of prompts to use with Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook) in the GitHub Copilot documentation.

## Provide the right context and tools

Enrich your prompts with relevant context to get more accurate and relevant responses in chat. Withe the right tools, you can boost your developer productivity.

*   In [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_agent-mode-tools), select the tools button to configure the tools you want to use or explicitly add then to your prompt.
*   Use `#codebase` to let Copilot find the right files automatically by performing a code search.
*   Use the `#fetch` tool to fetch content from a web page or use `#githubRepo` to perform a code search on a GitHub repository.
*   Reference files, folders, or symbols in your prompt by using `#<file name>`, `#<folder name>`, or `#<symbol>`.
*   Drag and drop files, folders, or editor tabs onto the chat prompt.
*   Add problems, test failures, or terminal output to your chat prompt for scenario-specific context.
*   Add images or screenshots to your prompt to let Copilot analyze the image.
*   In agent mode, prompt to preview your app to directly open it with the built-in simple browser.

When you use [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode), Copilot autonomously finds the relevant files and context for you.

Get more details about [adding context to chat prompts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context).

## Reusable prompts

Prompt files enable you to save a prompt for a specific task with its context and instructions in a Markdown file. You can then attach and reuse that prompt in chat. If you store the prompt in your workspace, you can also share it with your team.

To create a reusable prompt:

1.  Create a prompt file with the **Chat: New Prompt File** command in the Command Palette.
    
    This command creates a `.prompt.md` file in the `.github/prompts` folder at the root of your workspace.
    
2.  Describe your prompt and relevant context in Markdown format.
    
    For example, use this prompt to generate a new React form component.
    
    ```
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component.
    
    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.
    
    Requirements for the form:
    * Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    * Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
    * Always define TypeScript types for your form data
    * Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
    * Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
    * Use `yup` for validation:
    * Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
    * Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
    * Customize UX-friendly validation rules
    ```
    
3.  Optionally, add metadata about how to run the prompt in chat. Use the `mode` field to specify the chat mode, and the `tools` field to specify which agent mode tools to use.
    
    ```
    ---
    mode: 'agent'
    tools: ['githubRepo', 'codebase']
    description: 'Generate a new React form component'
    ---
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component based on the templates in #githubRepo contoso/react-templates.
    
    Requirements for the form:
    * Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    * Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
    * Always define TypeScript types for your form data
    ```
    
4.  Run the command by typing `/`, followed by the prompt file name in the chat input field.
    
    For example, type `/new-react-form` to run the prompt file named `new-react-form.prompt.md`.

Get started with [prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental).

## Choose your AI model

Copilot offers different AI models to choose from. Some models are optimized for fast coding tasks, while others are better suited for slower planning and reasoning tasks.

Model type

Models

Fast coding

*   GPT-4o
*   Claude Sonnet 3.5
*   Claude Sonnet 3.7
*   Gemini 2.0 Flash

Reasoning/planning

*   Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking
*   o1
*   o3-mini

Choose the model that best fits your needs by using the model picker in the chat input field.

Learn more about [AI models for Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat) in the GitHub Copilot documentation.

## Workspace indexing

Copilot uses an index to quickly and accurately search your codebase for relevant code snippets. This index can either be maintained by GitHub or stored locally on your machine.

For GitHub repositories, you can use a remote index of your workspace, based on [GitHub code search](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-github#asking-exploratory-questions-about-a-repository). This allows Copilot to search your entire codebase very quickly, even if the codebase is very large.

## https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-extensibility-overview

# AI extensibility in VS Code

Visual Studio Code has many AI features to improve your coding experience, such as code completions, or natural language chat. You can further extend the built-in capabilities, for example by contributing tools for [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode), or adding AI-powered features to your VS Code extension.

Depending on your use case, you have the following options for extending AI in your VS Code extension:

*   **Agent mode tool**: use the [Language Model Tool API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tools) to contribute a tool for [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode) that is invoked automatically based on the user's prompt. Integrate deeply in VS Code by using other extension APIs in your tool.
    
*   **MCP tool**: automatically register external [MCP tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) that can then be used in [agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode). As an extension developer, you can [register an MCP tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/mcp) as part of your extension. MCP tools run outside of the VS Code extension host and don't have access to the VS Code extension APIs.
    
*   **Chat participant**: use the [Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat) and [Language Model](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) APIs to create a chat participant for [ask mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode) that enables users to ask domain-specific questions by using natural language.
    
*   **Use AI model**: use the [Language Model API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model) and the [VS Code extension APIs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/overview) to build custom AI-powered features into your extension and enhance editor-specific interactions.

Alternatively, you can also build a GitHub Copilot Extension, implemented as a GitHub App with additional capabilities. Copilot Extensions work across all supported IDEs and GitHub, but don't have access to functionalities specific to VS Code. Get more info about [Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions) in the GitHub documentation.

## Use cases

Here are some examples of how you can use AI in your VS Code extension:

*   **Docs querying**: use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to query a third-party documentation service and generate responses based on the retrieved information.
    
*   **AI-assisted coding**: use the AI model to provide editor annotations to provide coding suggestions.
    
*   **AI-powered reviews**: use the AI model to review your code for security vulnerabilities or performance improvements.
    
*   **Data retrieval**: query a database or third-party data service to retrieve information about a specific topic.
    
*   **Enterprise coding assistant**: get chat responses that are grounded in the data of your enterprise and are aware of the specific coding guidelines your company follows.
    
*   **Enhance extensions**: use the Language Model API to add AI-powered features to your existing VS Code extensions.

There are several examples already available in the Visual Studio Marketplace that extend AI in VS Code:

*   Agent mode tools: Go to the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Alanguage-model-tools&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) or search for the `language-model-tools` tag in the [Extensions view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions).
    
*   Chat participants: Go to the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Achat-participant&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) or search for the `chat-participant` tag in the [Extensions view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions).

## Get started with AI extensibility in VS Code

To get started with extending AI in your VS Code extension, explore the following resources:

## Copilot Chat

### Copilot Chat features aren't working for me?

Check each requirement if Copilot Chat doesn't work:

*   Make sure you are on the latest version of Visual Studio Code (run **Code: Check for Updates**).
*   Make sure you have the latest version of both the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions.
*   Your GitHub account that is signed into VS Code must have an active Copilot subscription. Check your [Copilot subscription](https://github.com/settings/copilot).
*   Verify that you have not reached your limit of chat interactions for the month with the [Copilot Free plan](https://docs.github.com/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/about-github-copilot-free).

### Why is my Copilot Chat extension blocked?

If you receive a message that an extension is blocked from using Copilot Chat, the extension was likely disabled due to a detected pattern of abuse coming from that specific extension. Contact the publisher of the extension when you encounter this issue. You can find the publisher information on the extension details page in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

# Making chat an expert in your workspace

In this article

To ask questions in chat about your entire codebase, you can reference `@workspace` or `#codebase` in your chat prompt. Based on the question, chat intelligently retrieves relevant files and symbols, which it then references in its answer as links and code examples.

## What is the difference between `@workspace` and `#codebase`?

Conceptually, both `@workspace` and `#codebase` enable you to ask questions about your entire codebase. However, there are some differences in how you can use them:

*   `@workspace`
    
    *   Chat participant, dedicated to answering questions about your codebase.
    *   Takes control of the user prompt and uses the codebase to provide an answer.
    *   Can't invoke other tools.
    *   Can only be used in ask mode.
    *   Example: `"@workspace how can I validate a date?"`
*   `#codebase`
    
    *   Tool that performs a codebase search based on the user prompt and adds the relevant code as context to the chat prompt.
    *   The LLM remains in control and can combine it with other tools for editing scenarios.
    *   Can be used in all chat modes (ask, edit, and agent).
    *   Examples: `"add a tooltip to this button, consistent with other button #codebase"`, `"add unit tests and run them #codebase"`

It's recommended to use `#codebase` in your chat prompts, as it provides more flexibility.

## Prompt examples

*   Finding existing code in your codebase:
    *   `"@workspace where is database connecting string configured?"` - Explains where and how the database connection is configured
    *   `"@workspace how can I validate a date?"` - Finds existing date validation helpers in the codebase
    *   `"@workspace where are tests defined?"` - Provides the location of test suites, cases, and related references and configurations
*   Making plans for complex code edits:
    *   `"@workspace how can I add a rich tooltip to a button?"` - Provides a plan for using the existing tooltip component with button elements
    *   `"@workspace add a new API route for the forgot password form"` - Outlines where to add the new route and how to connect it to the existing code
*   Explaining higher-level concepts in a codebase:
    *   `"@workspace how is authentication implemented?"` - Overview of the authentication flow and references to the relevant code
    *   `"@workspace which API routes depend on this service?"` - Lists the routes that use the service in the selected code
    *   `"How do I build this #codebase?"` - List the steps to build the project based on documentation, scripts, and configurations

## What sources are used for context?

To answer your question, workspace context searches through the same sources a developer would use when navigating a codebase in VS Code:

*   All [indexable files](#_what-content-is-included-in-the-workspace-index) in the workspace, except for files that are ignored by a `.gitignore` file
*   Directory structure with nested folder and file names
*   GitHub's code search index, if the workspace is a GitHub repository and [indexed by code search](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/copilot-chat-in-github/using-github-copilot-chat-in-githubcom#asking-a-question-about-a-specific-repository-file-or-symbol)
*   Symbols and definitions in the workspace
*   Currently selected text or visible text in the active editor

Note

`.gitignore` is bypassed if you have a file open or have text selected within an ignored file.

## How does `@workspace` find the most relevant context

Your full VS Code workspace can be too large to pass entirely to GitHub Copilot for responding to your chat prompt. Instead, `@workspace` extracts the most relevant information from the different context sources to ground Copilot's answer.

First, `@workspace` determines which information is needed to answer your question, also including the conversation history, workspace structure, and currently selected code.

Next, it collects the context using different approaches, such as finding relevant code snippets by searching locally or by using [GitHub's code search](https://github.blog/2023-02-06-the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search), and using VS Code's language IntelliSense to add details like function signatures, parameters, and more.

Finally, this context is used by GitHub Copilot to answer your question. If the context is too large, only the most relevant parts of the context are used. The response is marked up with references to files, file ranges, and symbols. This enables you to link directly from the chat response to the corresponding information in your codebase. The code snippets that were provided to Copilot are listed as references in the response.

## Managing the workspace index

Copilot uses an index to quickly and accurately search your codebase for relevant code snippets. This index can either be maintained by GitHub or stored locally on your machine.

You can view the type of index and its status in the Copilot status dashboard in the Status Bar.

![Screenshot showing the workspace index status in the Copilot status menu.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/reference/workspace-context/workspace-index-status.png)

### Remote index

If your code is hosted in a GitHub repository, you can build a remote index with [GitHub code search](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/about-github-code-search) to enable AI to search your codebase quickly, even for large codebases.

To build a remote index for your workspace:

1.  Sign in with your GitHub account in VS Code.
    
2.  Run the **Build Remote Workspace Index** command in the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands))`.
    
    It may take some time for the remote index to be built, especially for large codebases. You can monitor the status of the remote index in the Copilot status dashboard in the Status Bar.
    
    You only need to build the remote index once. GitHub automatically keeps it up-to-date whenever you push code changes.

Important

Remote indexing requires a project with a git remote on GitHub. Make sure that you have pushed your code to GitHub too. The remote index works best if GitHub has a relatively up-to-date version of your code, so make sure to push your code to GitHub regularly.

### Local index

If you can't use a [remote index](#_remote-index), Copilot can use an advanced semantic index that is stored on your local machine to provide fast, high quality search results. Currently, local indexes are limited to 2500 indexable files.

To build a local index:

*   The project has less than 750 indexable files: Copilot automatically builds an advanced local index.
    
*   The project has between 750 and 2500 indexable files: run the **Build local workspace index** command in the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands))`. This command only needs to be run once.
    
*   The project has more than 2500 indexable files: see the [basic index](#_basic-index) section below.

It may take some time to build the initial local index or update the index if many files have changed (such as when switching git branches). You can monitor the current local index status in the Copilot status dashboard in the Status Bar.

### Basic index

If your project does not have a [remote index](#_remote-index) and has more than 2500 [indexable files](#_what-content-is-included-in-the-workspace-index), Copilot falls back to using a basic index to search your codebase. This index uses simpler algorithms to search your codebase and has been optimized to work locally for larger codebases.

The basic index should work just fine for many questions. However, if you find that Copilot is struggling to answer questions about your codebase, try upgrading to a [remote index](#_remote-index).

### What content is included in the workspace index

Copilot indexes relevant text files that are part of your current project. This is not limited to specific file types or programming languages, however Copilot automatically skips over some common file types that are typically not relevant to `@workspace` questions, such as `.tmp` or `.out` files. Copilot also excludes any files that are excluded from VS Code using the [files.exclude](vscode://settings/files.exclude) setting or that are part of the `.gitignore` file.

Copilot also currently does not index binary files, such as images or PDFs.

## Tips for using workspace context

The way you phrase your question can significantly influence the quality of the context and the accuracy of the response. To optimize results, consider the following tips:

*   Be specific and detailed in your question, avoiding vague or ambiguous terms like "what does this do" (where "this" could be interpreted as the last answer, current file, or whole project, etc.).
*   Incorporate terms and concepts in your prompt that are likely to appear in your code or its documentation.
*   Review the _used references_ in the response to ensure that the files are relevant. Iterate on your question if necessary.
*   Explicitly include relevant context by selecting code or mentioning chat variables such as `#editor`, `#selection`, or `#<file name>`.
*   Responses can draw from multiple references, such as "find exceptions without a catch block" or "provide examples of how handleError is called". However, don't anticipate a comprehensive code analysis across your codebase, such as "how many times is this function invoked?" or "rectify all bugs in this project".
*   Avoid assuming information beyond the code (for now), such as "who contributed to this file?" or "summarize review comments for this folder".
